Alan Axelrod in his book, <a href=#>Mercenaries</a>, discusses how ninjas were the only soldiers for hire in feudal Japan. <a href=#>Ninjas were recruited</a> for jobs primarily focusing on espionage, assassination, reconnaissance, and as fifth columnists. They were also hired for infiltration of enemy fortifications and sabotage. Ninjas could be retained for individual missions or a military campaign. In this last case, ninjas were valued for their ability to act as covert operators to disrupt enemy encampments and act as surprise shock troops.</p><p dir=ltr>Ninjas, because of their covert activities, often elicited distrust, including from their employers.

According to <a href=#>Business Insider</a>, ninjas in feudal Japan made an inflation adjusted $8,000 to $17,000 a year, though it is unclear how this was calculated.
