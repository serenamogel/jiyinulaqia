So&nbsp;it's not a&nbsp;surprise that they get repeated here, much less to learn that there were&nbsp;subsequent attacks on Katz’s thesis, including a <a href=#>reevaluation by the rector of Haifa University</a>&nbsp;that called his research methods and his advisors’ oversight of them flawed, and concluded that there was no way to prove that over 200 people were killed, the number might’ve been as low as 40 or&nbsp;50, and it was impossible to establish that every single one of them was a murder victim.</p><p>Filmmaker <a href=#>Alon Schwarz</a> was aware of the political&nbsp;minefield he was&nbsp;walking into by choosing this subject, and that's undoubtedly why the storytelling treads&nbsp;lightly. The result is&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;fragmented and unfocused in its arrangement of different voices, at times&nbsp;letting things "drop," as one soldier on the audiotape repeatedly puts&nbsp;it,&nbsp;when pushing and probing might have yielded more&nbsp;insight. (Maybe Schwarz didn't feel he could push things further because so many of his camera subjects&nbsp;were in their eighties and nineties&nbsp;and were already uncomfortable being challenged.) And while one understands why only Israelis were interviewed—Schwarz seems to be&nbsp;going for something like the <a href=#>Claude Lanzmann</a> and <a href=#>Marcel Ophuls</a>&nbsp;Holocaust documentaries that&nbsp;confronted perpetrators and enablers of war crimes—there are points when the viewer might still wonder if the result would have been richer, though messier and more explosive, if he'd widened the pool of subjects (remember, the demographic makeup of&nbsp;Katz's original batch of&nbsp;tapes was 50/50).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tmKespaeubrnOr6CeZaKaw6qx1mZpaWpi</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
