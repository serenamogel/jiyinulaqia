The scripted thriller-drama’s second season is in production, and it’s been linked to a 2024 release window. The success of Squid Game also directly led to the inception of Squid Game: The Challenge — a reality TV show pitting hundreds of contestants against each other in pursuit of a $4.56 million jackpot.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Netflix</a>, approximately 81,000 people from across the globe applied to take part in the competition. All in all, 456 individuals were chosen to don the famous green tracksuits and associate themselves with a number in place of their name. Netflix gave a breakdown of where the 456 competitors hailed from, with the high majority being from Western English-speaking countries. More than half were American, while around 100 lived in the United Kingdom.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>There was representation from more than a dozen other international locations, including Brazil, Singapore, Japan, South Africa, and The Philippines. Most of the players were in their 20s (173) or 30s (139). There were also 63 people in their 40s, 51 in their 50s, 25 in their 60s, and five in their 70s — 53.4% were men, 46.4% were women, and 0.2% identified as non-binary.</p><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=934 data-injectable=true>Tayo, better known as player No. 107 on Squid Game: The Challenge, shared his experience with the casting process in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube video</a>. Tayo said a friend had forwarded him an advertisement on Instagram calling for people to apply for the show. “I did like a little one-minute video just saying, ‘Put me in the show. I want to win it,’ all of this,” he recounted. “And then [I] got a call back the next day, and after a couple interviews later — a lot of phone calls and Zoom call interviews — I managed to get the gig.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>The casting process lasted around two to three months, Tayo said. “I managed to get it,” he continued. “I’m super grateful. Again, I think about 90,000 people applied. So, to be one of those 90,000, that was insane.”</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Squid Game: The Challenge was filmed in January 2023 in England.
