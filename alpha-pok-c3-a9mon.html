Regardless of the species' normal behavior, alpha Pokémon (except for <a href=# title="Mantyke (Pokémon)">Mantyke</a> and <a href=# title="Mantine (Pokémon)">Mantine</a>) are always aggressive towards the player and will never run away, unless a <a href=# title="Space-time distortion">space-time distortion</a> appears around it or it is a species which only appears in the wild at certain times of day.

Alpha Pokémon, of the same species as the location's standard spawns, each have a small chance of appearing (between a 0.2% and 2% chance). Each location has its own rates for how likely each alpha Pokémon may spawn, including space-time distortions. Prior to the Daybreak update, during <a href=# title="Mass outbreak">mass outbreaks</a>, at most one alpha Pokémon could appear, however this limit was later lifted to account for the "exclusively alpha" bonus waves of <a href=# title="Mass outbreak">massive mass outbreaks</a>.</li><li>During a massive mass outbreak, clearing all Pokémon in a location may cause a second wave of Pokémon to appear in the same location; if this occurs, the second wave may be composed entirely of alpha Pokémon.</li></ul><p>During the battle against <a href=# title="Giratina (Pokémon)">Giratina</a> at the <a href=# title="Temple of Sinnoh">Temple of Sinnoh</a>, it will be filled with <b>Terrible Might</b> (Japanese: <b>すさまじい力</b> <i>Tremendous Strength</i>), which has an identical effect to Wild Might.</p><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Scarlet and Violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>, alpha Pokémon <a href=# title=Transfer>transferred</a> from Legends: Arceus will gain the Alpha <a href=# title=Mark>Mark</a>.

Amongst animal groups, an alpha is a member of the species that has a higher rank in the group's hierarchy, contrary to the beta members who are the more submissive ones. Alpha animals often employ aggression tactics to assert dominance and leadership over their specific groups. This concept may be seen in gameplay, where alpha Pokémon display an aggressive disposition even when members of said species typically would not. They also serve as leaders of the pack, as alpha Pokémon are regularly found in places where unevolved members of their species gather, and even show signs of territorialism, as some alpha Pokémon tend to come to the aid of the lesser members when alerted. Their Japanese name "boss" seems to reinforce this idea of hierarchical leadership.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_other_languages>In other languages</span></h2><p><i>Alpha Pokémon</i></p><p><i>Wild Might</i></p><p><i>Terrible Might</i></p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=See_also>See also</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX3a5sbTAmIeoo1V4gGaNmKampw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
