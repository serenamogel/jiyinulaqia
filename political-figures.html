The 64-year-old made the surprise announcement October 28 at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual conference. “I’m leaving this campaign, but let me promise you, I will never leave the fight for conservative values, and I will never stop fighting to elect principled Republican leaders to every office in the land,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mike-pence-suspends-campaign-president/story?id=104451113" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said Pence" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said Pence</a>, who is the first major candidate to leave the race.

After losing two bids for a U.S. congressional seat, he successfully ran for Congress in 2000, rising to the powerful position of Republican conference chairman. In 2012, he was elected governor of Indiana. Named <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump</a>’s running mate in July 2016, Pence served as vice president of the United States for one term, from 2017 until 2021. He unsuccessfully ran for president during the 2024 election, dropping out prior to the Republican primaries.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Michael Richard Pence<br>BORN: June 7, 1959<br>BIRTHPLACE: Columbus, Indiana<br>SPOUSE: Karen Pence (1985-present)<br>CHILDREN: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Gemini</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Early Life and Education" data-anchor-id=early-life-and-education class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Michael Richard Pence was born on June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana. One of six children to Nancy and Edward Pence, a U.S. Army veteran who operated a series of gas stations, Mike was politically influenced by the Irish Catholic leanings of his family. He grew up idolizing former President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-f-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John F.

Kennedy</a> and volunteered for the Bartholomew County Democratic Party as a student at Columbus North High School.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While church had played an important role in Pence’s early family life, he became more deeply religious as a student at Hanover College, where he became a “born-again Evangelical Catholic.” Later, he fully embraced evangelical Christianity and converted.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His college days also saw an evolution of his political ideology. He voted for incumbent <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/jimmy-carter data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jimmy Carter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jimmy Carter</a> in the 1980 presidential election but became inspired by Carter’s successor, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ronald Reagan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ronald Reagan</a>, and the Republican Party. After graduating with a bachelor’s in history in 1981, he moved to Indianapolis in 1983 to attend the Indiana University McKinney School of Law, earning his juris doctor in 1986.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=14 title="Early Professional Career" data-anchor-id=early-professional-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Professional Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pence went into private practice following his graduation and tried his hand at politics by becoming a precinct committeeman for the Marion County Republican Party. Seeking to make a bigger splash, he ran for Congress in 1988 and 1990, losing both times to Democrat Phil Sharp. However, Pence learned a valuable lesson in defeat; disgusted by his own line of attack ads, he penned an essay in 1991 titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner” and vowed to preach a positive message from then on.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, his public profile continued to grow. Pence served as president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation from 1991 through 1993, before making the leap to radio talk show punditry with The Mike Pence Show. Referring to himself as “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/rush-limbaugh data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rush Limbaugh" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rush Limbaugh</a> on decaf,” Pence was unapologetic in his support of a conservative agenda but was commended for his level-headed manner and willingness to listen to opposing views. His radio show was syndicated in 1994, and he branched out to television as a morning show host the following year, before ending both programs in 1999.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 title="U.S. Congressman" data-anchor-id=us-congressman class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">U.S. Congressman</h2><img alt="mike pence stands behind a desk with a congressional seal on the front, he looks at a man on the right of the desk as a man on the left side watches on, pence wears a suit with a white shirt and red tie, behind him is a window with ornate curtains and two flags" title="Mike Pence in his congressional office with staff in March 2005" width=2980 height=2004 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/congressman-mike-pence-meets-with-staff-at-his-office-on-news-photo-1686073557.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Mike Pence meets with staff at his office on Capitol Hill in March 2005. He represented Indiana in the House for 12 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pence revived his political career by running for Congress again in 2000, this time winning a seat. Describing himself as “a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order,” he quickly demonstrated that he wasn’t afraid to buck party lines. He opposed President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/george-w-bush data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George W. Bush" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George W. Bush</a>’s No Child Left Behind policy in 2001, as well as the Medicare prescription drug expansion the following year. While his positions rankled party elders, they bolstered his reputation as a man of strong convictions, and he easily won reelection five times.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Climbing the ranks of Republican leadership, Pence was named head of the Republican Study Committee in 2005. He was unsuccessful in his bid to become minority leader in 2006, losing to Ohio’s John Boehner, but two years later, he was unanimously elected to the powerful position of Republican conference chairman.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A staunch fiscal conservative, Pence insisted on cuts to the federal budget before supporting funding for Hurricane Katrina relief efforts in 2005 and was among the leading opponents of the federal bailout in 2008. He also drew attention for his social views, notably supporting a plan to shut down the government over a fight to defund Planned Parenthood in 2011.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 title="Indiana Governor" data-anchor-id=indiana-governor class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Indiana Governor</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2011, Pence announced his intention to run for governor of Indiana the following year. Despite strong name recognition and a platform focused on tax cuts and job growth, he became embroiled in a heated race with Democrat John Gregg, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After he became governor, Pence had his congressional papers, which are housed at Indiana University in Bloomington, sealed. According to the donor agreement, the public is forbidden from seeing many of his papers from the 12 years he served in Congress until his death. (The original agreement stipulated the collection could have been unsealed on December 5, 2022, if Pence were to have died before that date.)</p><img alt="mike pence stands behind a podium featuring a state of indiana seal, he speaks and extends his hands out in front of him, he is wearing a gray suit jacket with a white shirt and red tie, behind him are blue drapes, an american flag, and an indiana state flag" title="Indiana Governor Mike Pence in March 2015" width=3500 height=2333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/governor-mike-pence-of-indiana-holds-a-press-conference-news-photo-1686073925.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Indiana Governor Mike Pence speaks at a 2015 press conference in Indianapolis about the state’s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2013, Pence signed a $1.1 billion give-back, the largest tax cut in state history. He also signed into law the state’s first pre-K funding program and steered funds toward infrastructure improvements. By 2016, Indiana was enjoying a $2 billion budget surplus and a pristine triple-A credit rating, though critics pointed out that the state’s wages were below national average.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pence found himself in the national spotlight and on shaky ground after signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in March 2015. Intending to protect business owners who didn’t want to participate in same-sex weddings, Pence instead encountered resistance from moderate members of his party and corporations that threatened to pull out of the state, and he was forced to alter the bill to provide exemptions for LGBTQ communities. Similarly, he came under fire in the spring of 2016 for signing a bill to prohibit abortions when the fetus has a disability.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 title="Donald Trump’s Running Mate and 2016 Election" data-anchor-id=donald-trumps-running-mate-and-2016-election class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Donald Trump’s Running Mate and 2016 Election</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly after announcing his intention to run for a second term as governor, Pence returned to the national spotlight when he surfaced as the vice presidential candidate for likely 2016 Republican nominee <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump</a>. Although Pence had opposed some of Trump’s views, he was believed to be a good running mate for the New York business mogul given his ties to congressional leaders and strong support among conservatives. (Pence had originally endorsed Republican presidential candidate <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ted-cruz data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ted Cruz" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ted Cruz</a> during the primaries.)</p><img alt="a profile shot of donald trump and mike pence standing on a stage shaking hands, both men wear suits, on the stage floor around them are red, white, and blue balloons and behind them is a blurred crowd" title="Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate Mike Pence at the 2016 Republican National Convention" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump-and-news-photo-1686074848.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate Mike Pence on stage at the end of the Republican National Convention in July 2016</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On July 15, 2016, Trump officially announced that Pence was his choice for vice presidential nominee via Twitter. At a press conference a day later, Trump called Pence “a man of honor, character, and honesty.” Days later, Pence accepted his party’s vice presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. In his acceptance speech, Pence remained composed and spoke of his running mate Trump:</p>“You know, he’s a man known for a larger personality, a colorful style, and lots of charisma. And so, I guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket.“Donald Trump gets it. He’s the genuine article. He’s a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers. And when Donald Trump does his talking, he doesn’t tiptoe around the thousand new rules of political correctness. He’s his own man, distinctly American. Where else would an independent spirit like his find a following than in the land of the free and the home of the brave?”<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On November 8, 2016, Pence was elected vice president of the United States when Donald Trump won the presidential race, defeating Democratic candidate <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/hillary-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hillary Clinton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hillary Clinton</a>. The stunning Trump-Pence victory was considered a resounding rejection of establishment politics by blue-collar and working-class Americans.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On November 11, Trump named Pence the head of his transition team, replacing New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Pence’s office also said he would continue to serve as Indiana governor until his term ended on January 9, 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Back in his home state, Pence found himself in a legal battle to try to conceal the contents of an email sent to him by a political ally. The email was connected with Pence’s decision to have Indiana join other states in suing to block President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barack-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barack Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barack Obama</a>’s executive actions on immigration. Bill Groth, a Democratic lawyer, sought to have the contents of an attachment to the email made public in an appeal of an earlier court decision in which the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that it was “not for the court to decide” whether to release the emails. Pence’s defense team countered that the contents of the email were protected from being released under the state’s Access to Public Records Act.</p><h2 data-node-id=37 title="U.S. Vice President" data-anchor-id=us-vice-president class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">U.S. Vice President</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On January 20, 2017, Pence was sworn in as U.S. vice president by Supreme Court Justice <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/clarence-thomas data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clarence Thomas" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Clarence Thomas</a>.

As vice president, Pence cast a historic vote to confirm a Cabinet nominee, led the administration’s COVID-19 pandemic response, backed the president’s agenda, and defended Trump on numerous occasions, including his two impeachments. He also outlined the administration’s plans to create a sixth branch of the U.S. military, the Space Force.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pence was said to have fostered strong relationships with the men who preceded him in the executive branch, conversing with former Vice President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/joe-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joe Biden" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Joe Biden</a> at least once per month and also meeting with Bush’s former second-in-command, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/dick-cheney data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dick Cheney" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dick Cheney</a>, to exchange ideas and solicit advice.</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Betsy DeVos Confirmation Vote</h2><img alt="betsy devos stands with one hand raised and the other on a book held by husband dick devos, she looks at and speaks to mike pence who holds an open folder, behind them are two flags" title="Vice President Mike Pence swears in Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in 2017" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vice-president-pence-dick-devos-and-betsy-devos-participate-news-photo-1686075361.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Vice President Mike Pence swears newly confirmed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on February 7, 2017, as her husband, Dick DeVos, looks on.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pence played an important role in the confirmation of Betsy DeVos, President Trump’s nominee for education secretary. Amid protests from Democratic critics and teachers unions that DeVos, a billionaire charter school supporter with no public school experience, was unqualified for the position, the Senate deadlocked in a 50-50 tie. On February 7, 2017, Pence cast the historic tie-breaking vote to confirm her, the first time a vice president has been called on to break a tie in a cabinet nomination.</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Michael Flynn Controversy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A week later, it was revealed that another Trump appointee, National Security Adviser <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/military-figures/michael-flynn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael Flynn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michael Flynn</a>, had misled Vice President Pence about his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, prior to the inauguration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to The Washington Post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to The Washington Post</a>, Flynn “privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials.” Vice President Pence had <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-michael-flynn-russia-contact-strictly-coincidental/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="appeared on CBS News’ Face the Nation" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">appeared on CBS News’ Face the Nation</a> stating that Flynn had told him that he and Kislyak “did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Flynn resigned on February 13, 2017, after less than one month on the job, and in his letter of resignation he wrote: “Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador.”</p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Foreign Affairs</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Early on in the Trump administration, the vice president defended the controversial rollout of President Trump’s executive order to ban immigrants from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for at least 90 days, temporarily suspend the entry of refugees for 120 days, and bar Syrian refugees indefinitely.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In January 2018, weeks after President Trump raised an outcry by announcing his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, Pence visited the region. Much of his trip focused on working with U.S. partners to counter terrorism and helping Christian minorities in the Middle East, though he also attempted to smooth over things with Arab leaders. That aspect didn’t work out as well, as Pence and King Abdullah II of Jordan publicly “agreed to disagree” over the decision to recognize Jerusalem, while Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas refused to even meet with the American vice president.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Among Pence’s other trips abroad were a December 2017 visit to Afghanistan, where he met with Afghan officials and U.S. troops, and an October 2019 stop in Turkey with U.S. Secretary of State <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/mike-pompeo data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mike Pompeo" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mike Pompeo</a>.

Citing his experience with the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) as Indiana governor, Pence stressed the importance of partnerships between state and local governments and health authorities when responding to infectious diseases and said he would determine the “best options for action to see to the safety and well-being and health of the American people.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While his regularly scheduled press briefings were soon dominated by the presence of Trump, Pence focused on delivering measured versions of the president’s fluctuating pronouncements, coordinating efforts with governors and addressing matters of supply shortages. On March 9, he announced that testing capabilities had increased to the point where 5 million tests would be distributed by the end of that week.
