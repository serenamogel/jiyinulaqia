The giant among giants of the retail world, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart</a>, has Microsoft’s next-generation console listed on its site. As of 10:30am EST, there were still consoles in stock, but those weren’t expected to last much longer.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stock Informer</a>, which tracks sales on several sites, lists the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Store</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">StockX</a> as the only places where you can still buy the Series X, though Walmart had the console listed as available for purchase on its site. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>’s listing for the system is “available by invitation.”</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>It’s been a bountiful Black Friday for gamers this year. Not only can you finally get your hands on the next-gen Xbox, but the elusive <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony PlayStation 5 has been much easier to nab</a> than at any point over the past two years.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>Between the two systems, these have given gamers headaches just to find them in stock. It’s been akin to buying hard-to-get concert tickets than gaming consoles. The low availability has resulted in mad dashes for the refresh key as potential buyers counted down the seconds on their browsers, hoping to get a crack at owning one.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Those opting for the brick-and-mortar route have found it nearly impossible to get their hands on either system. A year ago, it was not uncommon to find patrons lining up the night before, setting up tents, and sleeping on sidewalks to get an Xbox Series X or a PS5. Even then, there were no guarantees of success, which made for many frustrated gamers.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>It all stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020 lockdowns, like many other manufacturers, Sony and Microsoft found it difficult to get all the parts needed to build their respective consoles. It resulted in a small output, and stores would typically get around 50 of each system in stock at a time. Naturally, that caused a huge spike in demand, which we are still seeing two years after the initial launch dates for both consoles.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=89 data-injectable=false>All that being said, rejoice, gamers, because today could be your day if you act quickly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXa2vsMSMrJyroZWoerl5yKxkrKyZoblutc1mqq2nk6B6osCMrZ%2Beq5ViwKrAxKxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
