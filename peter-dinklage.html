He moved to New York City in 1991 to work in theater. In 1995 Dinklage made his film debut in Living in Oblivion. His next major career breakthrough came with 2003's The Station Agent. Dinklage continued to win over critics with his performance in the television series Game of Thrones, winning Emmys for his role of Tyrion Lannister in 2011, 2015, 2018 and 2019.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Genetic Condition</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Actor Peter Dinklage has captivated film, television and theater audiences with his expressive blue eyes, powerful presence, wit and charm. The Emmy Award and Golden Globe winner discovered a passion for performing while growing up in Morristown, New Jersey.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born to average-sized parents, Dinklage learned early on that he had achondroplasia, a genetic condition that affects bone growth. A person with this form of dwarfism usually has a normal-sized head and torso but short limbs. While he has come to accept his condition, Dinklage found it challenging sometimes while growing up. “As an adolescent, I was bitter and angry, and I definitely put up these walls," he told MSNBC. "But the older you get, you realize you just have to have a sense of humor. You just know that it’s not your problem. It’s theirs."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dinklage got his first taste of theatrical success in a fifth grade production of The Velveteen Rabbit. Playing the lead, he was delighted by the audience's response to the show. "When you get your first solo bow, that feels pretty good," he explained to People magazine. At the Delbarton School, a Catholic prep school for boys, Dinklage continued to seek out applause as part of the drama club.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a student at Bennington College, Dinklage appeared in numerous productions. He graduated in 1991 and then moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. With a friend, Dinklage started a theater group in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood. While this initial venture flopped, he landed some work in off-Broadway shows.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Film, TV and Theater</h2><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Living in Oblivion,' 'The Killing Act,' 'The Station Agent'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While he had only a minor role, Dinklage made an impressive debut in the 1995 parody of the independent film world, Living in Oblivion.

He was very enthusiastic about the series, telling reporters after his Golden Globe win that the show had a "smart narrative." "You've got to push the envelope and challenge expectations and ideas of what's going to happen next," he said. "That adds to the addiction of the show—you never know what's around the corner."</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'X-Men,' 'Avengers,' 'My Dinner with Hervé'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His profile boosted by his Game of Thrones exposure, Dinklage enjoyed more screen opportunities in the years to come.
