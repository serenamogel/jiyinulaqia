Maas</a></strong> has slowly turned into one of the biggest names in genre fiction, with works that quickly find their way into the New York Times best-seller list and end up bagging community trophies like the Goodreads Choice Awards.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Now, after finishing the two ambitious fantasy series Throne of Glass and A Court of Thorns and Roses, J. Maas is currently busy at work on the new Crescent City, with the final book in the trilogy (titled House of Flame and Shadow) slated for release in 2024.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>If you love your fantasy with a scoop of romance, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">then Sarah J. Maas should be your next reading obsession</a>.</p><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=889 data-injectable=true>Now, I know what some of you may be thinking. When we talk about genre fiction, that combination usually leads to some very negative predispositions bordering on snobbery, and most wouldn’t hesitate to put it down in the infamous young adult category. Sarah J. Maas certainly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has elements of YA in her writing</a>, and the love triangles are enough to make every Wattpad smut writer blush, but where J. Maas treads, there’s a clear distinction between literary value and the so-called fluff, fast food-y fiction.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Still, getting into her books won’t be easy, as J. Maas has more than a dozen books to her name out there. So to make matters simpler for you, we’ve decided to list all of her books in order of release. Check them out down below.</p><h2 id=h-all-sarah-j-maas-books-in-order-of-release data-injectable=false><strong>All Sarah J.

Throne of Glass Coloring Book came out in 2016, while the encyclopedic World of Throne of Glass is still forthcoming.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>After reading Throne of Glass, you can start your Faerie journey through A Court of Thorns and Roses:</p><ul data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true><li>A Court of Thorns and Roses (2015)</li><li>A Court of Mist and Fury (2016)</li><li>A Court of Wings and Ruin (2017)</li><li>A Court of Silver Flames (2021)</li></ul><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>J.

As they say, though, you never know if you’ll love or hate it unless you pick it up yourself. And based on how much of an avid reader you are, that journey could take anywhere between a few months to a few years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeSpLysv46ao6Vln5t6tK3Rmp9mol2irqK%2FjJumqKOjYravec6rm56qXaG2tMDEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
