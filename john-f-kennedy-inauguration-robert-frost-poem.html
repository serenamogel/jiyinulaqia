Kennedy's Inauguration</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On March 26, 1959, prior to a dinner in honor of his 85th birthday, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/robert-frost data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Frost" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Frost</a> held court before a throng of reporters at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria hotel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fielding a question about the supposed decline of New England, his longtime home base and poetic muse, Frost responded, "The next president of the United States will be from Boston. Does that sound as if New England is decaying?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To the follow-up question of who he was talking about, Frost replied: "He's a Puritan named Kennedy. The only Puritans left these days are the Roman Catholics. There. I guess I wear my politics on my sleeve."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Puritan he spoke of – <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/john-f-kennedy-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John F. Kennedy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John F. Kennedy</a> – was still serving as a junior senator from Massachusetts and several months shy of formally announcing his candidacy. Still, JFK was pleased to receive the early endorsement and soon wrote Frost to thank him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The poet kept up his unofficial work on behalf of the Kennedy campaign, repeating his prediction of the election outcome at numerous public events. The Democratic candidate, in turn, adopted the final stanza of Frost's poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" to close his stump speech: "But I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep."</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Kennedy personally invited Frost to read at JFK's inauguration</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following his narrow victory over <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/richard-nixon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Richard Nixon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Richard Nixon</a> in November 1960, Kennedy extended an offer to have Frost become the first poet to read at a presidential inauguration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Replying by telegraph, Frost wrote, "If you can bear at your age the honor of being made president of the United States, I ought to be able at my age to bear the honor of taking some part in your inauguration. I may not be equal to it but I can accept it for my cause – the arts, poetry, now for the first time taken into the affairs of statesmen."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kennedy then asked Frost if he could compose a new poem for the ceremony. When that was rejected, the president-elect requested a reading of "The Gift Outright," an ode to American exceptionalism first published in 1942 and described by its author as "a history of the United States in a dozen [actually, 16] lines of blank verse."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kennedy had one more request, to change the final line about our great nation, "Such as she was, such as she would become," to the more optimistic "such as she will become." Although not typically inclined to tweak his careful wording, the poet grudgingly agreed.</p><img alt="Lyndon B.

Titled "Dedication," the poem sounded many of the same patriotic notes as "A Gift Outright," only with explicit references to contemporary events ("The greatest vote a people ever cast, / So close yet sure to be abided by").</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On the morning of the inauguration, January 20, 1961, Frost presented the poem to incoming Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall in his hotel room. Pleasantly surprised, Udall had a new copy typed up before whisking Frost off to the ceremony with the poet intending to read "Dedication" as a preamble to "The Gift Outright."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The sun was so bright that Frost was unable to read 'Dedication'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The inauguration unfolded on a sunny but bitterly cold day at the U.S. Capitol. Approximately one hour in, Frost made his way to the podium and began reading "Dedication," but soon stopped: the sun's glare, reflecting off the snowy ground, was far too bright for a pair of 86-year-old eyes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Vice President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/lyndon-b-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lyndon B. Johnson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> tried to block the sun with his hat, but Frost abandoned the effort altogether and began reciting "The Gift Outright" from memory.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Heeding Kennedy's request, he closed the short poem with his own added emphasis: "Such as she was, such as she would become, has become, and I – and for this occasion let me change that to – what she will become."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The audience roared with approval, seemingly not noticing the poet thanking the "president-elect, Mr. John Finley."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following day, The Washington Post cited the reading as one of the highlights of the ceremony, noting, "Robert Frost in his natural way stole the hearts of the inaugural crowd."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Indeed, although Frost was reportedly embarrassed by the turn of events, it became a triumphant capstone to his career, an unscripted moment that memorialized his association with an iconic president at the dawn of a new chapter in American history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGinqKSZqbakrctmnaKfpaeytHvJqJ%2BnZZZiuKa6zZ6bsmWZo662s9SrmK2hn6N6s7vBnqmtZZanvLTAjKmmnqU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
