The Birth of A Nation actor was spotted in Hollywood with his wife, Sarah DiSanto, and kids as they headed over to El Capitan Theatre to see the premiere of Disney’s The BFG.</p><p>Sarah led the way as the family crossed the street. The expectant celebrity mom held her and Nate’s youngest daughter’s hand while the older sibling walked beside dad.</p><p>Many fans are waiting in great anticipation for Nate Parker’s performance as Nat Turner in Birth of A Nation. The actor tells <a href=#>PEOPLE</a> that the role was especially near and dear to his heart because he was heavily involved in the creation process.</p><p>“Far too often, as a black actor…you receive a hundred scripts in a year, and two of them you feel represent the experience of the black male with strength and power and integrity,” he says. “I felt the need to, instead of complaining about that, to find a way to change it with my art. So I started writing. I wrote several scripts, but Nat Turner and his life was one that I wanted to really delve into as a writer.”</p><p>Birth of A Nation is expected to hit theaters in October. Nat Parker and his wife are expecting their little one to arrive in coming weeks.</p><p></p><p>Photo: Splash News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kG9maW5fZ4BwusCtnGaokae4pr6MmqWdZZaWuqq42Gacp6KfrnqiecyoraKdXZ67brTOpaOyr5%2BksXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
