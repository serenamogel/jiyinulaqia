He explained that the two were putting up thousands of dollars on each roll.</p><p>“I was there, I watched it. Got in the middle of it, stopped it,” he said. “It would have blazed that night. Over dice. If it wasn’t for Wack, that n***a would have been in the morgue that night. I told Dugg, ‘You all the way wrong.'" At one point, Dugg wanted to leave but the <a href=# class=text-word rel>Migos</a> rapper remarked: “As long as it’s my dice, you got to shoot," according to Wack. "But Dugg walked out of the studio, leading to a confrontation between the two. [<a href=# class=text-word rel>Offset</a>] did it like a gangsta, went in Dugg’s pockets, took his money and fired on Dugg. One-on-one. Woomp, bow! ‘You got me f*cked up.'"</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Akademiks Suggests Offset & Lil Baby Beef Began Over Dice Game</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-offset-amp-lil-baby-perform-in-atlanta>Offset & <a href=# class=text-word>Lil Baby</a> Perform In Atlanta</h2></span><p>ATLANTA, GA - APRIL 20: Offset and Lil Baby perform at Lil Baby & City Girls In Concert at Coca Cola Roxy on April 20, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia.(Prince Williams/Wireimage)</p><p>Wack says he had to intervene at that point to prevent an all-out brawl. "I grabbed 42 Dugg, told his little homies, ‘Y’all put that up. Offset, go back in the studio.’ Offset had his little goons with him, they wasn’t budging. I said, ‘Offset, you know there’s gon’ be hell to pay come the morning.’ We were at QC studios." He added: "This was like right before Dugg sparked; he wouldn’t have been around for his spark. Offset and some of his people would’ve been dead. QC studios would’ve been under investigation."
