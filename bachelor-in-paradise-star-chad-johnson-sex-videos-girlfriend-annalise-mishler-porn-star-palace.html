He plans on moving to Las Vegas to set up his own 'porn palace.' Startled? Even though it may seem like a controversial career choice to make, Chad is confident about the move.&nbsp;</p><p>His girlfriend Annalise Mishler and him have been taping raunchy videos that go up on OnlyFans at regular intervals. These videos in question help the on-off couple make close to $40K a month, Chad claimed.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've always had a really crazy high sex drive so it's been pretty easy for me, to be able to make money off of it is f***ing amazing. I don't regret it at all, I always knew I'd do something in this industry I just wasn't sure what," Chad told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DailyMail</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The site has 1500 people who pay $27 a month to watch their clips, which feature everything but sex but they are getting there. "It's a process," he said. "We're doing stuff every two or three days and putting out more stuff, getting crazy with it," Chad added. "It's a lot more than I ever made from TV, I'll say that," Chad told the site and added that the 'Bachelor' shows paid him $1,800 "while they made millions".&nbsp;</p><p>This is his way of getting the "power" back and an opportunity to show Hollywood who he is really is. His <a href=# rel>reality TV star</a> status and sponsorship deals disappeared after he was arrested for domestic violence. Chad pleaded not guilty to the six misdemeanor charges, which came after a "blazing row" with Annalise in February. A pre-trial hearing has been pushed to May 22 owing to the COVID-19 crisis that has the world gripped.</p><p>But Chad has had a difficult few years, not just on the relationship and career front but also family-wise. He hasn't been able to move on from his mother's death and has been issues with alcohol as well. The 'Bachelor' shared that he has been going to therapy sessions to deal with problems that have been bogging him down for the past nine months.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his sister has expressed her being ashamed of his newfound direction but Chad isn't really taking that bit into consideration. He is currently more invested in how to get everything in motion, set up his porn production company and have a house in LA, where people could fly in.&nbsp;</p><p>"Everything is going really well, if this keeps up and I start to really make this all work, I'm going to probably move to Vegas and just going to keep the ball rolling," Chad revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRompGYtaa4zqtkoqZdpa6zrcOiqp5lo6mus3nCoZidZZqkta%2B%2FzqdkrJ2oYsOqsMSoqmafmae5p77InqWdZZGju6K4yKycZqWZqLWtsdFmp6iqnmLAta3RZqeapJGYsg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
