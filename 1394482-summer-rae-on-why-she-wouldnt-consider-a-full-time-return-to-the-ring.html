When asked about the rumors of a 2023 Royal Rumble return, Rae said that came about due to working out in the ring in January for cardio.</p><p>“Yeah. So I recently I think it was like in January, I went in the ring, Tenille was going back to the Royal Rumble,” Summer Rae said. “Wait, that was this year. Yeah. And she said when she showed up to the rumble practice that all of the girls were like, where’s Danielle?</p><p>“And she’s like, what do you what do you mean? She’s like, Danielle, like she’s in the rumble, right? And they’re like, No. So she’s like, why is the why the hell is she training? And I’m like she’s like, I don’t know, she just wants to cardio. So it was interesting that the girls thought I was like, like, fabing them. Like, I’m gonna tell like, the girls, you know.”</p><p>When asked if had any interest in a return to the ring in the future, Rae admitted that while she does miss it, she wouldn’t risk it due to a bone spur in her neck.</p><p>“So I miss wrestling,” Summer Rae admitted. “I personally wouldn’t, I have a bone spur on a vertebra in my neck and I have Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. So I’m doing good, but at the end of my injury, I kind of have the tingling in my hands where I couldn’t really open doors and that was a little scary to me. So for me, I miss storytelling.</p><p>“I constantly write ideas and pitches down and like, submit them to certain promotions. And I have all these ideas that I miss and I do want to be a part of it again, I do think I have a lot more to give. And especially from like, I was telling you a standpoint of being present in the moment, how I would do things so differently, so much more confident and have fun with it, like so much more fun.</p><p>“I don’t think I could wrestle every week and be in that role. And I don’t think that’s my purpose, either. I think, you know, being able to highlight talents, and pull the best out of them and being able to make them the main thing and being able to showcase new younger talent and bring them up with what I know from the business. I would love to do something like that.”</p><p><a href=#>Summer Rae Has Aspirations To Manage The Lucha Bros, Team With Orange Cassidy</a></p><p>What do you make of Summer Rae’s comments?
