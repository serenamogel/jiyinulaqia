However, he likely won’t face jail time.</p><p>The security guard, Euwan James, was eventually terminated from his position&nbsp;for the way he handled the situation. Tip’s attorney, Steve Sadow,&nbsp;reportedly called the charges “baseless, ill-founded and unjustified.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“T.I. never threatened or acted in a violent manner towards Euwan James, the security guard,” Sadow said. “Indeed, we understand the security guard was fired for the way he handled the situation with T.I.</p><p>“We had sincerely hoped that the Henry County Solicitor had better, more important, things to do to serve the Henry County community than prosecute an African American over a verbal dispute during an encounter with a security guard who was asleep at his post and was unwilling to provide his name to T.I. so T.I. could report the guard’s misconduct to his employer.”</p><p>The alleged incident occurred in the Atlanta area outside of the Eagle’s Landing Country Club. James reportedly wouldn’t allow T.I. to enter the premises without a key. Once he was inside, Tip then returned to the guard shack to confront James. The guard called the police because he reportedly felt threatened, which is enough to constitute simple assault in Georgia.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Tip was arrested</a> and taken to jail where he eventually posted a $2,250 bond for his release.&nbsp;[apple_news_ad type=”any”]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZkbIN5gY6toK2klWPBbrWMq5ypp6KpsqW42GaqpZmgpbKledaiq6FlY2K6qr%2FDnqSemZ6kv26vx5qpoJ2jYrOwvoydqa6mm5q7br%2FEnKyroaSueqjBwKubZqGemLalsc2t</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
