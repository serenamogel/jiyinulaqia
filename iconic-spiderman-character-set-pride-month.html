The biggest is <a href=# rel=noopener>one-off Marvel’s Voices: Pride, their first-ever queer-centered special</a> which puts their LGBTQ+ characters front and center. We’re also getting a series of Pride Month variant covers featuring out heroes including Wiccan, Northstar and Mystique.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>But it seems that Marvel Comics will celebrate the month by having a classic <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Spider-Man</a> </strong>character officially come out of the closet as well. This is Felicia Hardy/Black Cat, who regularly crosses the line between being an ally and antagonist to Spidey (and often a flirtatious romantic interest).</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=true>Right now, she’s the star of her self-titled solo series, with Black Cat #7 out today. The current plot line sees Hardy dealing with the New York City Thieves Guild, which is led by Odessa Drake. Hardy and Drake have had a fractious relationship, frequently clashing over Drake’s more overtly villainous methods. But, as seen in the issue, they’re currently on good terms. Extremely good terms, in fact.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>Here are some pages (via BleedingCool.com):</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JCxa-WvT.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/oO7sih4y.jpg><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>Hardy being bisexual won’t come as a huge surprise to readers, as her solo series has dropped some heavy hints in previous issues (plus <a href=# rel=noopener>she has her own Pride variant cover</a>), but her and Drake kissing removes any last lingering doubts. It’ll be fun to see where this story goes, too. After all, most of Hardy’s romantic partnerships end badly and Drake being a crime boss doesn’t bode well, but hopefully they can find some happiness for a few issues before it all goes pear-shaped.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, Marvel’s LGBTQ+ writers and artists have been sounding off on how much comics meant to them while growing up. Writer Anthony Oliveira said:</p><p>“When I was a very closeted, very lonely kid, these characters saved my life. It’s an honor to tell stories about them and to see the kind of stories queer people can tell about queer people deepen and grow.”</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>Steve Orlando, meanwhile, has also stated how much it means to him to contribute to the Pride special, saying:</p><p>“What an honor to be part of MARVEL’S VOICES: PRIDE! I could not be more excited to help spotlight LGBTQ+ characters new and old at the House of Ideas, as well as joining a stable of LGBTQ+ creators behind the scenes for this special.”</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Black Cat #7&nbsp;is out now, and Marvel’s Voices: Pride #1 hits comic stands on Wednesday, June 23rd.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX56wsLrInGSsqJmZsrO5wKdknKCRp66kwMSrZKydpGK9s7XDnmSmp56ptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
