Even before the advent of heterogeneous SoC designs, processors built on large rings or meshes can have different latencies to access the nearest core compared to the furthest core. This rings true especially in multi-socket server environments.
But modern CPUs, even desktop and consumer CPUs, can have variable access latency to get to another core.</description></item><item><title>Lance Chantiles-Wertz movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</title><link>/lance-chantiles-wertz.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/lance-chantiles-wertz.html</guid><description>Movie Reviews TV/Streaming Great Movies Chaz's Journal Contributors Black Writers Week Cast and Crew Find on IMDB Find on Wikipedia Reviews The Clovehitch Killer (2018) Brian Tallerico Billy

But this interpretation is shallow, supposing that dialogue alone gives a character an inner life—or that silence can’t be strategic. Though my life might seem far removed from the gangland squabbles that drive the film, I can relate, deeply, to the ways that Scorsese, screenwriter Steven Zaillian, and Gallina and Paquin, render the theme of parental estrangement: I know what it’s like to grow up under the thumb of a father who believes that tenderness is beneath him, who only understands that might makes right, even—or perhaps, especially—if it’s cruel.</description></item><item><title>What Exactly Happened To Aunt Diane?

This isn’t a “thriller,” because we’re not thrilled, or scared-only amused. The murder itself has a certain antiseptic, ritualistic quality, and the investigation is an exercise in sophisticated cross-examination and sputters of indignation. What I liked best about this movie is its style, both the deliberately old-fashioned visual strategies used by director Sidney Lumet, and the cheerful overacting of the dozen or more suspects.</description></item><item><title>Old Cheatu - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</title><link>/index-php.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/index-php.html</guid><description>From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.

It’s not quite curly, yet it’s not quite straight, which places it in a nebulous state, landing somewhere in between the two. Since it’s not one or the other, that can make it difficult to find the right products and tools like hair masks, hair dryers, and, most infuriatingly, shampoos. And though the versatility of wavy hair gives you free range to master practically any style, trying to do so is an exercise in futility if you’re not using the right formula that caters to your specific texture, length, and hair density.</description></item><item><title>Singer Sio Becomes The Latest Isgubhu Cover Star; Check This Out</title><link>/singer-sio-becomes-the-latest-isgubhu-cover-star-check-this-out.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/singer-sio-becomes-the-latest-isgubhu-cover-star-check-this-out.html</guid><description>South African vocalist, poet and storyteller, Sio has been announced as the next Isgubhu cover star by apple music to celebrate her new album and features.

Try Chile Peppers for a change.
Rocoto chiles (also known as manzanos or manzanas) are very fiery but simultaneously sweet and citrusy, and they are used to create huge peppadew-like chilies. If you can’t handle the intensity, use Hungarian cherry peppers, which are moderately spicy but sweet and citrusy. To lessen the heat of the rocotos, soak them in water overnight.
