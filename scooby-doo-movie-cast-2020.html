It's been two decades since the movie came out and, while childhood Scooby Doo fans have the new <a href=#>Scoob! movie coming to VOD</a> to look forward to, we can't help but be a little nostalgic.</p><p>But <a href=#>where is the cast</a> of the surprisingly-good movie about the Mystery Inc. gang? Read on to find out what they're up to in 2022.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Freddie Prinze Jr.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter/Getty</span></figure><p>Freddie's role as the Mystery Inc. ringleader came at the height of his career, having just had roles in hits like She's All That.</p><p>Freddie and his then-girlfriend, now-wife Sarah Michelle Gellar married in September the same year Scooby Doo came out. The couple now have two children together.&nbsp;</p><p>Scooby Doo and the movie's sequel were the last of his biggest roles. After the cartoon-based franchise, Freddie took a step back from acting. Now, most of his roles are as a voice actor in various cartoons, and he's said he's basically retired from acting.</p><p>"I love being a full-time father," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. "To remove myself from that equation would not be a good thing. I'm basically retired."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Sarah Michelle Gellar</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter/Getty</span></figure><p>Playing alongside her fiance, Sarah Michelle Gellar starred as the purple-clad Mystery Inc. member Daphne in Scooby Doo. She and Fred had a romance that bloomed as the movies progressed, solidifying their relationship on-screen.</p><p>After marrying Freddie in 2002, she gave birth to two children: Charlotte, born in 2009, and Rocky, born in 2012.</p><p>Like Freddie, she's largely taken a step back from acting, only appearing in smaller roles in TV shows and TV movies, as well as taking on more voice acting positions.&nbsp;</p><p>The former horror movie queen has since stepped back from the limelight, and her social media proves she's enjoying the time she spends with her family.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Linda Cardellini</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter/Getty</span></figure><p>Unlike Sarah and Freddie, Linda Cardellini's career has arguably taken off sincer her role as the awkward but super smart Velma in Scooby Doo.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after Scooby Doo and Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed finished filming, Linda took on the role of Cassie in Brokeback Mountain, and she's continued to land big roles since.</p><p>She starred on TV as Samantha Taggart in ER and Sylvia Rosen in Mad Men, as well as other major films like Avengers: Endgame, The Curse of la Llorona and Greenbook. Like Sarah and Freddie, Linda also ventured into voice acting, landing major, recurring roles in Gravity Falls, The Regular Show, and Sanjay and Craig. These days, you can catch her on the Netflix hit Dead to Me.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Matthew Lillard</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter/Getty</span></figure><p>Matthew Lillard's role as the loveable but clumsy Shaggy in the Scooby Doo movies really opened doors for him... to continue being Shaggy.</p><p>While his 2002 role as the character was the first time he had tackled Shaggy Rogers, he has continued to voice the Mystery Inc. member in countless video games and cartoons focusing on the mystery-solving gang.&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew also starred as the infamous Stu in the Scream franchise and, while he's had various other minor roles both in TV and movies, his roles as Shaggy are arguably his most successful.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Neil Fanning</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter/YouTube</span></figure><p>You didn't actually see Neil Fanning in Scooby Doo, because he voiced the CGI'd Scooby. He brought a new personality to the spunky talking dog, even though you never saw his face.</p><p>Similar to Matthew's roles post-Scooby Doo, most of Neil's acting roles have been reprising the role of Scooby. Neil is also a stunt man, completing stunts in movies like Daybreakers and Ghost Ship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLCwu8GyZJ2nn2K6sMLInmScmaOpenN8kWk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
