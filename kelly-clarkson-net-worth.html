Because one of the judges is a friend of mine, I watched it for that reason, and then I fell in love with the show. I still watch Idol, and it’s still the most popular television show.</p><p>I still watch Idol, and it’s still the most popular television show, so I’m certainly not the only one who enjoys sitting at home and being entertained.”</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>Clarkson’s benign, down-to-earth image and approachability have made her a valuable sponsorship partner throughout her career.</p><p>Tresemme, Vitamin Water, Citizen, Ford, Apple, Toyota, Candie’s, NASCAR, American Greetings, Proactiv, Wayfair, Amazon, and Norwegian Cruise Lines are just a handful of her businesses.</p><h3>Book Publications</h3><p>Clarkson wrote the children’s book<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong> River Rose and the Magical Lullaby</strong></a> in 2016, which her kid-inspired.</p><p>She revealed to Publishers Weekly that creating a children’s book and writing music are two very different things and that she wasn’t quite ready to write the book at first (but it came out fantastically!).</p><p>“Oh, girl, it’s like night and day!

I’d been writing tunes for quite some time. “I believed to myself, ‘This will be simple for me,'” she claimed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kelly-books.jpg><p>“However, creating a children’s book is considerably more difficult! It’s a completely different animal.</p><p>David Linker would tell me that I needed to consider how a child would understand it and make it flow better to approach it from a child’s perspective. The meter and flow are completely different from what I’m used to, so it was a challenge.”</p><p>In 2017, Clarkson released <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>River Rose and the Magical Christmas</strong></a>, a sequel to River Rose and the Magical Christmas.</p><p>According to ZipRecruiter, children’s book writers on the high end of the company’s pay spectrum can earn around $136,000 per year.</p><h2>Divorce Finance</h2><p>Kelly, regrettably, filed for divorce in June 2020.
