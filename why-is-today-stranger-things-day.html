(Nov. 6)</h2><p>Think back to the first season of Stranger Things: Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Will, and Lucas were still barely pre-teens (wild, right?). Eleven and Mike hadn't kissed, <a href=#>Max and Billy</a> hadn't even moved to Hawkins, and Barbara was still in the picture (R.I.P. Babs).</p><p>But things quite literally turned upside down (get it?) when <a href=#>Will first vanished</a> during a bike ride home from Mike's house. And when did Will go missing? During Season 1, Episode 1, which took place on Nov. 6.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>That's right, folks — basically, on that day, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things Day was born</a>, according to Mental Floss.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Will's disappearance was undeniably difficult for Will, himself, as well as his mom, Joyce, and his clan of BFFs, Nov. 6 has been deemed the date that truly started it all.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Make sure to check out Stranger Things' tributes to our boy Will.</h2><p>Make your way to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show's official Twitter account</a>, (or scroll down). to see what the show is saying about Stranger Things Day.
