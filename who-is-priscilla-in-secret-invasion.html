Well, two weeks in and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Invasion</a></strong> promises to be among the best as it’s so far never letting up with the big surprises.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>Case in point, episode two ends with another jaw-dropping moment, although thankfully one that’s much less heartbreaking that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the cliffhanger of the premiere</a>. And it all concerns a brand-new character to the MCU. Although she’s not named on-screen this character is called Priscilla, as played by Charlayne Woodard. So who is Priscilla and what does she mean to Nick Fury? Let’s dive in?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-nick-fury-s-wife-priscilla-fury data-injectable=false>Who is Nick Fury’s wife, Priscilla Fury?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chrome_2023-06-28_09-41-25.png><p data-characters=640 data-current-count=940 data-injectable=true>Secret Invasion episode two’s final scene begins with a Skrull woman chopping up vegetables in the kitchen of a modernist, isolated home. We then see Nick Fury himself let himself into this house, looking naturally deflated after just being fired by Rhodey (who’s totally a Skrull, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but that’s a story for another time</a>). As Fury enters the kitchen, the woman — who has now shifted into human form — frowns at him and says “Haven’t you forgotten something?” Fury then plucks a wedding ring from the table and puts it on his finger, before the two kiss passionately. Yes, Priscilla is Nick’s wife!</p><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>OK, so, lot’s to unpack here. First of all, Priscilla is an original character for the MCU, although Nick has had various spouses over the years in Marvel Comics — namely, weapons smuggler Amber D’Alexis who bore his son, Mikel, Nia Jones, the mother of Nick Fury Jr., and Monica Chang, the ex-wife of the Fury from the Ultimate Universe. We really shouldn’t be surprised that MCU Nick has a wife, as he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned her way back in Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a>.</p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>The fact that Priscilla is a Skrull adds a whole other dynamic to their relationship too. On the face of it, it would seem Fury has a much more personal stake in the Skrulls’ relocation to Earth than we previously knew. However, it’s worth noting that Priscilla switches to human before her husband enters the room. Does he even know that she’s a Skrull? What if she’s been deceiving him this whole time and Fury’s greatest personal betrayal is still yet to come?</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false>Secret Invasion airs new episodes Wednesdays on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxloKe2tK%2FIpaOaZZmjerSxwqucrWWZo8Oiv8iopWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
