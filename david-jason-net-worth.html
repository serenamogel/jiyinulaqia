Only Fools And Horses reenacted this scenario.</p><p>In the ATV sitcom A Sharp Intake of Breath (1977–1981), he costarred with Alun Armstrong and Richard Wilson as Peter Barnes, the show’s protagonist.</p><p>He played Buttons in the pantomime Cinderella at Newcastle’s Theatre Royal in 1979, which was produced by Michael Grayson and directed by John Blackmore and starred Leah Bell and Bobby Thompson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is David Jason worth?</h2><p>David Jason has a net worth estimated to be about $10 million approximately as of 2023.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2Yr6GUYreiv86nZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
