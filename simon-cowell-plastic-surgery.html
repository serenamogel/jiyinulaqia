This was just a few months after he said he was done with Botox.</p><p style=color:#252525>Since then, the clip has been taken down because trolls made fun of his appearance and many said he looked like a ‚ÄúMadame Tussauds waxwork.‚Äù</p><h2><strong>All You Need To Know About Cowell‚Äôs Plastic Surgeries</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>During an interview with Glamour, Cowell talked about how much he loves Botox. He said, ‚ÄúTo me, Botox is no stranger than toothpaste.‚Äù It works; you only have to do it once a year; so what? Later, he said, ‚ÄúI got fillers that get rid of wrinkles by temporarily paralyzing muscles.‚Äù This may have made his brow heavy because his forehead muscles weren‚Äôt there to hold it up.</p><p style=color:#252525>In 2018, the record producer also got a ‚Äú21st-century facelift‚Äù to make himself look better. He chose to get a ‚Äúsilhouette soft lift‚Äù from Dr. Jean-Louis Sebagh, who is known as ‚Äúthe Picasso of dermatology.‚Äù</p><p style=color:#252525>The procedure costs ¬£2,000 and involves sewing a thread with bioplastic on it into the face and pulling it to stop it from sagging.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Simon-Cowell-BGT-twitter.jpg alt="Simon Cowell Britain's Got Talent promo video Twitter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p style=color:#252525>Simon told The Current in an interview, ‚ÄúThere are a lot of things you can do now. You don‚Äôt have to put filler and Botox all over your face. It hurts like hell, but it gets rid of sun damage and unplugs everything. Now, having clean skin is the most important thing to me. When your skin is clean, you look better.‚Äù</p><p style=color:#252525>He went on to say, ‚ÄúI changed my diet within 24 hours, and I haven‚Äôt looked back since. You Feel Better, You Look Better. I stopped eating a lot of things I shouldn‚Äôt have, mostly meat, dairy, wheat, and sugar. Those were the four main things.</p><h2>Simon Cowell Says He Regrets Getting Botox And Fillers</h2><p style=color:#252525>Simon Cowell went to the Nickelodeon Kids‚Äô Choice Awards in April 2022. There, he said that he‚Äôd gotten Botox injections and fillers in the past, but that he regretted it and wouldn‚Äôt do it again.</p><p style=color:#252525>Cowell told the audience, ‚ÄúThere was a time when everyone was getting injections in their faces.‚Äù He then said that his injections made him look like ‚Äúsomething out of a horror movie.‚Äù</p><p style=color:#252525>Hill thinks that Cowell had a procedure in which an ultrasound was used to find the fillers in his face and dissolve them.</p><p>https://twitter.com/Xx17965797N/status/1598307924945903617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598317640237424640%7Ctwgr%5Ea9deb45461ce2c2b96463eb19392022ec1156448%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shefinds.com%2Fcollections%2Fsimon-cowell-unrecognizable-botox-melting-face-video%2F</p><h2>Simon Cowell Before And After Picture</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Simon-Cowell-Before-After-Plastic-Surgery-Photos-01.jpg alt="Simon Cowell Plastic Surgery Makeover Exposed By Top Docs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>How Did The Fans React To Cowell‚Äôs New Look?</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>As soon as Simon showed up on TV, fans couldn‚Äôt stop reacting to the star‚Äôs appearance.
