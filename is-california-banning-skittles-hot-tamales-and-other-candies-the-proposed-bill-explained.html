It’s best to note that the additives mentioned have already been banned in the European Union (EU) after they were proven to pose significant public health concerns, including increased risk of cancer, behavioral issues in children, harm to women’s reproductive system, and damage to the immune system.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>The bill was introduced by Assembly members Buffy Wicks and Jesse Gabriel, who argued in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">news release</a> that “Californians shouldn’t have to worry that the food they buy in their neighborhood grocery store might be full of dangerous additives or toxic chemicals.” Gabriel added, “This bill will correct for a concerning lack of federal oversight and help protect our kids, public health, and the safety of our food supply.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>Although many of the chemicals in the bill may not sound familiar, they’re often used in everyday products like cupcakes, trail mix, and popular ice cream brands, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Label Insights</a> revealed. For example, in 2022, Skittles was sued after their colorful candy was accused of being “unfit for human consumption” because it contained a “known toxin.”</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration insisted that the regulated use of titanium dioxide, specifically as a color additive in food, was safe under certain restrictions. Gabriel alleged that “Many of the chemicals that would be banned have never been independently reviewed by the FDA or re-evaluated in decades” and instead have loopholed their way to consumption through the organization’s “Generally Recognized as Safe” law or GRAS designation.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KLFY</a> reported that AB-318 was double referred, meaning it would be heard by the Assembly’s Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee (ESTM) first and, if passed, would head to the Assembly’s Health Committee. So far, there is no hearing date set.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8isZJyZnJ6zsL7NophmmpGju6q6xmaqpKGkqbmmv4yhpq1lpJa6orjErGSappRivLW0xKtknJmembamv4ytn55loKe8sbvSnptmmpmhuW6x16mjmqGemrFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
