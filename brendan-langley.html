His practice squad contract with the team expired on January 20, 2020.</p><p>On March 18, 2019, it was announced that Langley would be converting from cornerback to wide receiver. He was waived on August 31, 2019.</p><p>On September 1, 2018, Langley was waived by the Broncos and was signed to the practice squad the next day. He was promoted to the active roster on November 20, 2018.</p><p>The Denver Broncos selected Langley in the third round with the 101st overall pick of the 2017 NFL Draft. Langley was the 18th cornerback selected in 2017, was the highest draft pick from Lamar since Tom Smiley in 1968, and was the first player drafted from Lamar in over 25 years (Tyrone Shavers, 1990 NFL Draft). He was also only the 19th player selected from Lamar and the fourth highest draft pick in school history.</p><p>On May 11, 2017, the Denver Broncos signed Langley to a four-year, $3.17 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $706,288.</p><p>He made his professional regular season debut during the Denver Broncos' season-opening 24–21 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. On November 26, 2017, Langely recorded his first two career tackles in a 21–14 loss at the Oakland Raiders. Langley was inactive for three games (Weeks 14–16) after he was surpassed on the depth chart by rookie undrafted free agent <a href=#>Marcus Rios</a>. He finished his rookie season in 2017 season with three solo tackles in 11 games and zero starts, while playing mostly on special teams.</p><p>On December 8, 2016, it was announced that Langley accepted his invitation to play in the 2017 Senior Bowl. Throughout the week leading up to the Senior Bowl, Langley was impressive in practice and showed fluid movement and an ability to break quickly to the ball, but was unable to hang on to receptions during receiving drills. On January 27, 2017, Langley appeared in the 2017 Reese's Senior Bowl as part of Chicago Bears' head coach John Fox's North team. Langley recorded three combined tackles and intercepted Tulane quarterback <a href=#>Antonio Pipkin</a> as the North lost 16–15 to the South. Langley was one of 60 collegiate defensive backs to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. He completed all of the combine drills and finished first among all defensive backs in the bench press and tenth in the 40-yard dash. On March 23, 2017, Langley attended Lamar's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only performed positional and coverage skills for team representatives and scouts from ten NFL teams. During the draft process, he had private visits and workouts with multiple teams, including the New England Patriots, Denver Broncos, New York Jets, Arizona Cardinals, Minnesota Vikings, and the Oakland Raiders. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Langley was projected to be a fourth to sixth round pick by NFL draft experts and analysts. Langley was ranked as the 24th best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com.</p><p>Brendan Langley (born October 16, 1994) is an American football wide receiver who is a free agent.
