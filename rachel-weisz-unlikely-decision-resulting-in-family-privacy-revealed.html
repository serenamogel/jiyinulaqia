"Celebrity – it really doesn’t mean anything to me. And it's no work at all to keep not showing up at events. It's no work at all, to keep a private life. Life can be demanding, life in a family can be complicated but I don’t even know what 'celebrity' means. I don't think of myself like that," she said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/48489246e3d2-gettyimages-497203452.jpg><p id=em5jVklj7ph data-wc=14>Rachel and Daniel share daughter Grace, four, and both have children from previous marriages.&nbsp;</p><p id=eV9WAa4OpL data-wc=10><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Rachel Weisz wows with leg-lengthening outfit with a twist</a></p><p id=efH53XkVB8 data-wc=15>The actress shares 16-year-old son, Henry, with her former fiancé, director Darren Aronofsky.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSRgjcNXVN data-wc=18>They started dating in 2001 before getting engaged in 2005, though they never married and split in 2010.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/234a0358fccf-gettyimages-945379572.jpg><p id=egyL-Q8SJs data-wc=23>Meanwhile, Daniel has a 31-year-old daughter, Ella, from his previous marriage to actress Fiona Loudon, who he was with from 1992 until 1994.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_2npXZFQz data-wc=15>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Rachel Weisz talks 'chaos' in family home with her rarely-seen children with Daniel Craig</a><br></p><p id=eyzk5jQqrj data-wc=17>Rachel ensures to balance her personal life and work schedule by having strict rules for herself too.&nbsp;</p><p id=eTHEWn9O0h data-wc=52>She told The Guardian: "When you have kids you do have to concentrate more on not bringing it home.
