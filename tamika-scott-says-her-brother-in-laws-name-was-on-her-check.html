‘due to his inability to be faithful’ and that she wasn’t physically attracted to him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Chris could not get the hint about Grace’s disinterest, and after Grace told him that ‘his physical ugliness is only surpassed by the ugliness of his character,’ he left the party.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The OP wrote that Grace ‘verbally tore him apart’ and discussed Chris’ infidelity toward his ex-wife.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Grace reminded him that he cheated and divorced his late ex-wife “Lily” while she was battling cancer and that he then got dumped by the mistress for being a cheater as he continued to cheat on her,’ the OP wrote.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Grace told him that he wasn’t a man of any significant value other than the few coins he had in the bank and that there’s no way in hell she’d entertain his delusions of sexual grandeur and beauty.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The sister-in-law’s aggravated friend then told him that he should consider ‘some cosmetic work’ and to ‘start praying for divine intervention to fix his rotten soul.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The OP’s in-laws and Chris are not thrilled that
