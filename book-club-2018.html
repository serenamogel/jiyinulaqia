He also is no fool, since he has a woman sharing in the writing and producing duties<strong><strong>—</strong></strong><a href=#>Erin Simms</a>, a fellow Redford alum. Together, they capture some of the throwback sisterhood spirit of “<a href=#>The First Wives Club</a>,” while aging it like a fine wine whose cork is ready to pop.</p><p>Speaking of which, much vino is consumed as the central quartet hold their meetings. Each character represents a distinctive romantic stage of older womanhood. Fonda’s Vivian is a never-wed, fabulously successful luxury hotel owner who has a huge appetite for sex but steadfastly shuns commitment. Keaton’s Diane (yes, they wrote the part for her) is a recent widow after 40 years of marriage. Her two grown married daughters (<a href=#>Alicia Silverstone</a> and <a href=#>Katie Aselton</a>) never consider that maybe she wouldn’t want to spend the rest of her days in the elder-care-ready basement in one of their Arizona homes. Bergen’s Sharon is an outwardly intimidating federal judge who hasn’t had a relationship of any kind, save with her cat, ever since her divorce 18 years ago. But now that her ex (<a href=#>Ed Begley</a> Jr.) and son are both engaged, she decides to give online dating sites a try. Steenburgen’s Carol is the only one of the bunch whose marriage is still intact as she lives out her dream as a successful chef with a bustling eatery. But she and hubby Nelson haven’t enjoyed any bedroom activity ever since his male pride took a dive after he retired six months ago.</p><p>Of course, all eventually ends well. Fonda’s old flame Johnson shows up to rock her world, Keaton becomes smitten by Garcia’s suave pilot (just ignore the fact that they were nephew and aunt in “The Godfather III”), Bergen gets busy in a car’s back seat with Dreyfuss, and Steenburgen and Nelson re-ignite their desire for each other on the dance floor to the strains of Meatloaf. It’s best not to spoil how they get to each point, but keep an eye on Murphy Brown<strong><strong>—</strong></strong>she’s a secret spitfire who speaks truth to power and deservedly gets the right to utter the lone F-word.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bpqijXZi5tq6Ma2dqcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
