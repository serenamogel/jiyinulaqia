Every January, the most common question readers ask me is, “What is a plant-based diet?” “Plant-based” is such a trendy term these days, and if you’ve been reading the blog for a while, you’ve probably seen me use it. But…what exactly does it mean?</p><p>You asked, I answered! Today, I’m sharing an overview of plant-based eating. This post is not intended to offer dietary, nutrition, or health advice. Instead, I hope it clears up some confusion about what people (including me!) mean when they say “plant-based.” And in case you’re considering – or already follow – a plant-based diet, it highlights recipes for cooking plant-based basics like vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/plant-based-diet/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whole-foods-plant-based-diet.jpg&description=Curious+about+eating+a+plant-based+diet%3F+This+handy+guide+offers+an+overview+of+healthy+plant-based+diets+and+includes+recipes+for+cooking+plant-based+basics+like+whole+grains+and+legumes%21+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23plantbased+%23diet+%23healthy+%23vegan")'></span></span></p><p>But first thing’s first:</p><h2>What is a plant-based diet?</h2><p>Turns out, there’s no single definition of a plant-based diet! Confusing, I know. If someone has a plant-based diet, they could be…</p><ul><li><strong>Totally vegan.&nbsp;</strong>In its strictest sense, “plant-based” refers to a vegan diet, one that includes&nbsp;only plant foods and no&nbsp;animal foods. For example, someone who is vegan might eat whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, but not eggs, honey, or dairy.</li><li><strong>Vegetarian.&nbsp;</strong>Plant-based can also refer to a vegetarian diet, one that centers around plant foods, such as vegetables and whole grains, but also includes small amounts of eggs or dairy.</li><li><strong>Pescatarian.&nbsp;</strong>Some people who follow a plant-based diet eat seafood, like salmon and shellfish, in addition to plant foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and seeds.</li><li><strong>An omnivore.&nbsp;</strong>Yep, some plant-based diets even include meat! In this case, meat, seafood, and other animal products are consumed in small quantities, but the diet mostly focuses on vegetables, fruits, and other plant foods. Ever heard of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Mediterranean diet</a>? It falls into this category.</li></ul><p>The common thread among these variations is that they include more plant-derived foods than animal-derived ones. In addition, these foods are whole foods – they’re not highly processed, and they don’t contain chemical additives or refined sugar. So while a diet of Oreos and Skippy is vegan, it isn’t plant-based. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">In an article for the Harvard Health blog</a>, Dr. Monique Tello writes that following a plant-based diet “means consuming mostly fruits and vegetables, including beans and legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains.”</p><p>At Love & Lemons, most of our recipes fall into the first and second categories of plant-based eating. Many of our recipes are vegan (check out <a href=#><span class=s1>this post</span></a> for 85 of our favorites!), and all of them are vegetarian, as we sometimes cook with eggs or dairy.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/plant-based-diet/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/what-is-a-plant-based-diet.jpg&description=Curious+about+eating+a+plant-based+diet%3F+This+handy+guide+offers+an+overview+of+healthy+plant-based+diets+and+includes+recipes+for+cooking+plant-based+basics+like+whole+grains+and+legumes%21+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23plantbased+%23diet+%23healthy+%23vegan")'></span></span></p><h2>What should I eat on a plant-based diet?</h2><p>The short answer: Ask your doctor! There is no one-size-fits-all approach to a plant-based diet (or any diet, for that matter). Each individual has different needs, goals, genetics, health risks, allergies, food sensitivities, etc. All of these factors can affect what foods make you feel and function best. Make sure to consult with a health professional anytime you consider dramatically changing the way you eat.</p><p>Still, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and plant-based protein sources are the building blocks of any plant-based diet. That’s where I can help! Here on Love & Lemons, we have guides to cooking all sorts of plant-based basics. Here are a few to get you started:</p><h2>Vegetable Basics</h2><p>You can’t eat a plant-based diet without veggies!

I use it like sour cream on <a href=#>baked potatoes</a> and in my <a href=#>French onion dip</a>, and it makes a wonderful cream sauce for <a href=#>pasta</a> and <a href=#>pizza</a>. To get your cashew cream really creamy, you’ll need a high-speed blender.
