Born on February 18, 1958, in Zeeland to Bernard and Jeanette (Knoll) Windemuller, John’s life was a testament to love, dedication, and a profound sense of community. His passing leaves a void in the hearts of those who knew him, but his legacy of warmth, hard work, and compassion will endure through the memories he created.</p><p>John’s journey began at Covenant Christian High School, where he laid the foundation for a life characterized by integrity and a strong work ethic. On June 22, 1979, he exchanged vows with the love of his life, Mary Vander Meulen, embarking on a journey that spanned 44 years of shared joys and sorrows. This union was a testament to their commitment, resilience, and unwavering support for one another.</p><p>Professionally, John dedicated many years of service to Excel Electric, starting in 1985. His commitment to excellence and hard work contributed to the success of the company, earning him the respect and admiration of colleagues and associates. John’s work ethic reflected his dedication not only to his craft but also to providing for his family and contributing to the well-being of the community.</p><p>Beyond his professional endeavors, John had a passion for raising Boxer and Akita dogs. His love for these animals extended beyond mere companionship; it was a reflection of his nurturing and caring nature. John and Mary’s commitment to fostering a love for animals led them to establish Country Winds Farms and Creamery on their Beaverdam farm, a testament to their love for the land and the creatures that inhabit it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKKfo3q4tc2dnKatnKGys3nOm6CtrZGnxm60zqWjmqaUYrqqec%2BeqaynnmK3sLqMsKCnnJWiwq24xKtkoZmjYr2iv9Kem2aZp5bGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
