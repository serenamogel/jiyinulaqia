Summer lawns also can be infected with insects, and Scotts Turf Builder with SummerGuard contains insect control to keep bugs from draining nutrients or damaging grass.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-scotts-summerguard-burned-lawn></span>Does Scotts Summerguard burned lawn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Scotts Turf Builder Summerguard Lawn Food with Insect Control is your remedy against summer lawn stresses. Summerguard feeds and strengthens against heat and drought by improving your lawn’s ability to absorb water and nutrients. <b>It won’t burn your lawn – guaranteed</b>!<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-temperature-do-you-apply-scotts-summerguard></span>What temperature do you apply Scotts Summerguard?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Answer: James, typically insects are most active when temperatures are <b>between 60 and 85 degrees</b>. You can still apply Scotts Turf Builder Summergard if the temperatures get above 85, however, if it is this hot at the time of application, be sure to water in immediately after.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-scotts-summerguard-work></span>Does Scotts Summerguard work?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>This product has been, by far, the <b>best of ALL the fertilizers I’ve</b> tried; Scotts and others included. In fact, this one was even better at turning my grass green than the Scotts Southern w/ 2% iron. Since my last fertilization of my yard, I keep telling my wife I’ve never seen our grass look so green.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-i-fertilize-my-lawn-before-or-after-rain></span>Do I fertilize my lawn before or after rain?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Ideally, you should aim to fertilize <b>about two days after rain or watering</b>, and when the next heavy rainfall is at least two days away. It can be helpful to have some rain before and after fertilizing. Rain a couple of days before fertilizing keeps your yard moist and the turf healthy, receptive to the nutrients.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-should-you-overseed></span>When should you overseed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The best time to overseed your lawn depends on where you live. In the cooler northern climates, the best time to overseed is in <b>late summer to early fall</b>. In fall the soil is warm enough to support germination, but the temperatures aren’t too extreme for the tender new grass to develop before winter sets in.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-apply-scotts-triple-action-in-august></span>Can you apply Scotts triple action in August?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Timing: <b>Apply summer lawn fertilizer once between June and August</b>, 6 to 8 weeks after the late spring feeding. Following the Scotts® Turf Builder® Annual Program? Apply the Summer product now to help make the most of each watering and encourage deep root growth.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-scotts-safe-for-dogs></span>Is Scotts safe for dogs?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You can let your dog back on the <b>lawn right</b> after applying Scotts® Turf Builder® Lawn Food, unless you choose to water immediately afterward. In that case, allow the lawn to dry before letting the dog out on it to help prevent the particles from being tracked back into the house.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-i-need-to-aerate-before-overseeding></span>Do I need to aerate before overseeding?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The most important step you can take before overseeding your lawn is <b>aerating your soil</b>. No matter what seed you use, they can’t germinate in compacted soil devoid of water, nutrients, and sufficient air exchange. That’s why it’s crucial to aerate your lawn before starting the overseeding process.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-i-aerate-before-overseeding></span>Should I aerate before overseeding?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>It is not a must that you aerate your lawn before overseeding</b>. However, since aeration loosens up compacted soil, improving the supply of oxygen, and provides nutrients and minerals to the new grass seed, it will improve germination and growth rates and help the grass grow thicker faster.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-fertilize-and-seed-at-the-same-time></span>Can I fertilize and seed at the same time?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When seeding a lawn, <b>you should never apply the fertilizer and seed together</b>. This can cause an uneven distribution of the materials resulting in patchy areas or seedlings burned by excess fertilizer. It is best to spread the fertilizer just prior to planting the seed.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-dethatching-the-same-as-aerating></span>Is dethatching the same as aerating?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The dethatching process removes the excess thatch and ensures that only a healthy layer remains on the surface. <b>Aeration</b> Process – Your lawn’s soil can become compacted over time due to pressure, weight, and gravity. This can make the surface hard, which can compress the roots and stifle them.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-dethatching-necessary></span>Is dethatching necessary?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Thatch builds up over time, so <b>it’s not necessary to dethatch every year</b>. Plan on dethatching every five years or so if your lawn needs it. You might want to give your lawn a quick check every year just to see how much thatch has accumulated.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-i-have-to-seed-after-dethatching></span>Do I have to seed after dethatching?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>After dethatching, <b>thatch should be removed and put in the compost pile</b>. If you do not already have a compost pile, then you should seriously consider adding one. After this has been done, high-quality grass seed. … This helps the seeds remain moist, and it provides essential nutrients, which enhances germination.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-after-aerating-should-you-seed></span>How long after aerating Should you seed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Within 48 hours</b> after you aerate you should over seed, fertilize, and water your lawn. The seed, fertilizer, and water will have the best chance to get down into the holes made by the aerator if applied soon after aeration.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-you-aerate-your-yard-every-year></span>Should you aerate your yard every year?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>No, it’s not necessary to aerate your lawn every year</b>, especially if your grass is healthy and thriving. Aeration is good if you’ve got compacted, poor or clay-heavy soil that’s been impacted by heavy equipment or lots of foot traffic. It’s also good to aerate if you are renovating a yard or installing a new one.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-month-should-i-aerate-my-lawn></span>What month Should I aerate my lawn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When to Aerate Your Lawn<p>You want to aerate the lawn when your grass is in its peak growing period so it can recover quickly—think <b>early spring or fall</b> for cool-season grasses, and late spring through early summer for warm-season grasses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBllKR6urvUZqysnV2osLDA06xkrK2dorKzs9SaqZ1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
