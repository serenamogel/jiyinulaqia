She directed the Oscar-nominated historical drama Selma (2014), which follows a portion of Dr. Martin Luther King’s life during an urgent call for voting rights. With this critically acclaimed work, DuVernay became the first African American female director to receive a Golden Globe nomination and have a film nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. In 2016, she directed 13th, a documentary about the criminalization of African Americans and the U.S. prison system, which received an Oscar nomination for feature documentary. DuVernay followed with the 2018 adaptation of the children's fantasy novel A Wrinkle in Time, before earning more acclaim for creating the 2019 miniseries When They See Us, about the five teens who were wrongfully convicted of the 1989 rape and assault of a Central Park jogger.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Ava Marie DuVernay<br>BORN: August 24, 1972<br>BIRTHPLACE: Long Beach, California<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Virgo</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">DuVernay was born on August 24, 1972, in Long Beach, California.
