Actor Ben Krueger, who plays coach Ben Scott, hints at what fans can expect.</p><p>Published on January 11, 2022</p><span></span><span>3 min read</span><p id=par-1_72>Fans keeping up with <a href=#>Showtime’s</a> Yellowjackets have a number of questions and theories going into the finale. The season started off with a bang, as it’s clear the girls on the high school soccer team who survived the plane crash eventually turn against each other and attack. And coach Ben Scott actor Steven Krueger recently talked about what fans can expect from <a href=#>the Yellowjackets finale</a>. Here’s what he said about upcoming “answers.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans continue to formulate ‘Yellowjackets’ theories as the season 1 finale approaches</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Yellowjackets-1.jpg><p id=par-2_71>Showtime’s Yellowjackets takes fans back and forth between the mid-’90s and 2021. In 1996, the Yellowjackets — a high school girls’ soccer team — were on their way to Nationals when <a href=#>their plane crashed</a> in the wilderness. The survivors of the crash scavenged and hunted for survival, but evil still lurks. The girls get rescued 19 months later, but the show takes its time unraveling what really happened in the wilderness.</p><p id=par-3_46>In the present day, some of the survivors, like Natalie, Shauna, Taissa, and Misty, are getting blackmailed by an unknown assailant. They join forces together to figure out what’s really going on while still dealing with the consequences of what happened to them 25 years prior.</p><p id=par-4_31>Several Yellowjackets theories speculate the surviving women ate the other girls on the team. Others think there are supernatural elements, and viewers can’t yet tell what’s real and what’s not.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Coach Ben actor Steven Krueger says the finale will bring ‘answers’ to fans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Yellowjackets-2.jpg><p id=par-5_65>Steven Krueger plays coach Ben, the soccer coach who loses his leg from the crash. He tries to maintain his authority over the girls, but he quickly loses it. <a href=#>Misty has a massive crush on Ben</a> as well, but when Ben tells her he’s gay, it doesn’t seem to go over well. It seems viewers will see some backlash from teen Misty in the finale.</p><p id=par-6_17>Krueger spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HollywoodLife</a> about what fans can anticipate in the final episode of the first season.</p><p id=par-7_29>“What I can say is that there will be some answers,” Krueger told the publication. “I think that’s kind of what people have been looking for since the beginning.”</p><p id=par-8_82>Krueger also mentioned some fans might get nervous that the writers don’t know how to tie up all the loose ends and plots they created throughout the season. But he’s telling fans they shouldn’t worry. “And I can say without a doubt that the writers know exactly what they’re doing,” he added. “Obviously, because there’s going to be another season, not everything gets tied up with a nice bow. There are some great cliffhangers, but we do start to get some answers.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-did-they-eat-in-yellowjackets-will-fans-get-an-answer-to-what-happened-in-the-opening-sequence>Who did they eat in ‘Yellowjackets’? Will fans get an answer to what happened in the opening sequence?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_48>The biggest question going into the Yellowjackets finale surrounds the first scene of the entire season. Who were the girls chasing in the woods, and why did they kill her? The girls also presumably ate the girl they killed, but fans still don’t know who that was.</p><p id=par-10_85>One Yellowjacket theory suggests the obvious answer is that Jackie was killed and eaten. The girls started to turn on Jackie toward the end of the season, and she’s wearing the necklace the girl who was chased and eaten was wearing. Additionally, we know Jackie died. But some believe that the opening sequence makes it too obvious that the girls hunted Jackie. There’s certainly the possibility that Lottie or Mari could’ve been hunted, but we’ll likely have to wait for season 2 to find out.</p><p id=par-11_80>As for deaths in the finale, Steven Krueger noted he couldn’t say what’s coming. “I won’t comment that there are any deaths in the finale,” he told HollywoodLife. “But, look, that’s going to be a part of our show going forward for however long it lasts. That’s going to be one of the big elements of surprise — who’s dying and when are they dying? And how are they dying? That’s going to be what everybody wants to figure out.”</p><p id=par-12_7>Check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTGprjLqK6jmZOgsrW%2FjJymmpuYYq%2Bmuoyamq2nomLAosXSZp2ippGhsm7DyKWjZpqinruoecCnqrCdoqh6uL7IrZyrq12gu7DDjJ6vmpukocZvtNOmo2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
