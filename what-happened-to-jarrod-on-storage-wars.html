Schulz has been a mainstay since the series debut in 2010, so his absence is undeniably a massive deal to longtime fans.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=577 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>For 13 seasons, Schulz hunted for treasure within storage lockers, betting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">against others</a> at auctions in California in hopes of winning and flipping undervalued items. Schulz and then-partner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brandi Passante</a> served as a duo during the first 12 iterations of the show — between 2010 and 2019 — and were coined “The Young Guns.” However, after Storage Wars ended its two-year hiatus in 2021 with a season 13 opener, it was revealed that Schulz and Passante had broken up. They remained on the show but ran their separate businesses and no longer worked together.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Did Schulz return for season 14 of Storage Wars?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Season 13 would serve as Schulz’s last, as he didn’t return for season 14, which began airing later the same year. A&E never released a statement on Schulz’s departure, nor did the reality television star.</p><p data-characters=599 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>Schulz was charged with one count of misdemeanor domestic violence battery in May 2021 — while his final season was airing — after Passante alleged he pushed her twice while they argued at a bar in Orange County, California, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ reported</a>. Schulz denied Passante’s accusations, per the outlet. A month later, Schulz’s attorney spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> and said Schulz wouldn’t take a plea deal unless it led to the case being dismissed. A trial date was set for July 12, but no information has been released about it, including whether or not Schulz and prosecutors reached an agreement.</p><h2 id=h-schulz-isn-t-on-storage-wars-season-15-either-and-has-been-running-a-bar-since data-injectable=false>Schulz isn’t on Storage Wars season 15 either and has been running a bar since</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Storage Wars season 15 began airing on June 6, and although Passante returned to the show, Schulz was nowhere to be seen, and it’s unclear if Schulz has continued searching for bargains with the cameras off.</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Schulz, who shares two kids with Passante — Payton and Cameron —has remained out of the limelight. He’s also inactive on social media. He’s only posted on his Instagram four times since the alleged altercation with Passante, which includes two pictures with Rochel Beckman. Considering Schulz and Beckman have kept their romance relatively private, their relationship status is unknown. Beckman’s Instagram profile does feature Schulzm, however. The Storage Wars star also hasn’t <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> since November 2017.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">its website</a>, Schulz purchased Rush Bar & Grill in Lake Forest, California, in April 2019. “Jarrod has owned numerous businesses and decided his next adventure would be to take on this new opportunity and adventure with the goal of running a great time neighborhood bar,” the site reads. “His goal has been to instill a family environment and exciting nightlife.”</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>The two other Instagram posts he’s shared since he received the misdemeanor charge were to promote his bar playing a Triller Fight Club event and food specials during Sunday football games. Although Schulz doesn’t actively post about it, Rush Bar & Grill has a packed schedule, including live music and karaoke nights.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=false>Schulz also owned the now-defunct clothing company <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Outlaw Apparel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZZqWv7O7w2amp2WjqbyzrcaeZLCZoqh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
