On this particular night, the mood was lighter than normal since it was a private event to thank the patrons who had supported the Royal Ballet and the performances were more offbeat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Toward the end of the evening, Diana slipped out of the Box. Charles reportedly assumed she had gone to use the ladies’ room, so he continued enjoying the program as dancer Wayne Sleep took the stage to tremendous applause.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But then a surprise guest joined him on stage — someone whose appearance shocked every single person in the opera house: Princess Diana was up on stage dancing with Sleep.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The audience gasped when Diana appeared, as if they’d all taken one huge breath,” Sleep told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/14/thats-me-diana-dance-wayne-sleep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Guardian</a> in 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What they didn’t know at the time was that Diana’s dance had been a long time coming. She had been rehearsing with Sleep and wanted to surprise her husband with the performance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an age before cell phone cameras and social media, it was never meant to go too far beyond those sitting in the opera house that night. But now it’s famously known as one of the princess’ most daring moments.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Diana initially approached Sleep for dance lessons</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Diana had long been impressed by Sleep. After all, he was once the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/05/wayne-sleep-height-net-worth-age-going-celebrity-big-brother-2018-7205679/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="principal dancer" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">principal dancer</a> in the Royal Ballet and also holds the world record for doing a jump with 12 feet switches called the entrechat-douze, which he did in 1973.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Our paths first crossed when she approached me for dance lessons in the early 1980s,” Sleep told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/14/thats-me-diana-dance-wayne-sleep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Guardian</a>. “Diana loved ballet, but she also wanted to learn jazz, tap, and contemporary. Sadly, I couldn’t teach her, because I was away on tour so much.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Diana’s dreams of dancing never went away. And when she got the idea of performing at the Royal Opera House’s annual event, she reached out to him again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This time, he was able to commit.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">The princess wanted to surprise Charles with her performance</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The young royal already had a clear idea in her head of her plan — she wanted to dance on stage alongside Sleep to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musician/billy-joel data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Billy Joel" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Billy Joel</a>’s “Uptown Girl.” But it had to be a truly zipped up secret since she didn’t want her husband to find out about it until she stepped on stage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We met in a rehearsal studio in west London,” he recalled to the paper. “She was in leg-warmers and a leotard. My first thought was, she’s too tall to dance with me, I’ll be a laughing stock: I’m 5-foot-2 and she’s 5-foot-11.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sleep’s height had long been a part of his career as a dancer. In fact, he was the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/05/wayne-sleep-height-net-worth-age-going-celebrity-big-brother-2018-7205679/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shortest male dancer ever" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">shortest male dancer ever</a> in the Royal Ballet School and had many roles specifically written for him because of his stature.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I soon realized she had a good sense of humor, and that we could have some fun with our height difference,” Sleep said as they started working together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The routine they came up with was packed with playfulness, while some even considered it tongue-in-cheek. “At one point, I pirouetted and she pushed me down,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/14/thats-me-diana-dance-wayne-sleep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the dancer said" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">the dancer said</a>. “Then I carried her across the stage. I remember thinking, ‘Don’t drop the future Queen of England.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thankfully it went off without a hitch. “The routine had a bit of everything: jazz, ballet, even a kickline,” Sleep said.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Diana didn't want to bow to Charles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The princess was absolutely delighted at the end of their choreography. She couldn’t believe that she had pulled off such a surprise. “She loved it, but was most thrilled we’d kept it secret from Charles, and our rehearsals away from the paparazzi,” Sleep said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the end of the performance, as per protocol, the performers always bow to the Royal Box. That’s when things got a little murky.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I said, ‘By the way, you’ve got to bow to the royal box,’” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rd.com/article/christmas-gift-prince-charles-hated/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sleep said" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Sleep said</a> when he was on Big Brother. “And she said, ‘I’m not bowing to him — he’s my hubby!’ And so I made her turn and bow, and as we ran off she went, ‘You won’t get your OBE [Order of the British Empire] that way.’”</p><img alt="Princess Diana and Wayne Sleep at Sadler's Wells Theatre" title="Princess Diana and Wayne Sleep at Sadler's Wells Theatre" width=1806 height=2627 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-52102557.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photo: Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images</span><p>Princess Diana and Wayne Sleep at Sadler’s Wells Theatre</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Prince Charles reportedly wasn’t happy with the surprise</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the audience was delighted, things apparently didn’t go over so well inside the palace.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/7931795/princess-diana-performed-billy-joels-uptown-girl-on-stage-prince-charles/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Some headlines" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Some headlines</a> said that Prince Charles felt like Princess Diana was “showing off,” while <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Diana_Chronicles/TOgnHjKG_6sC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=princess+diana+prince+charles+skit+royal+opera+house+%E2%80%9CJust+One+Cornetto.%E2%80%9D&pg=PA243&printsec=frontcover" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="others said" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">others said</a> that it made him “uneasy” that she performed without him — and still others suggested that he may have thought the dance was too “sexy.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Charles himself was no stranger to the follies that could happen on stage at this particular event — and in fact, he clearly had his own sense of humor too. The previous year, he and Diana got on stage together and did a Romeo and Juliet-type skit that involved him singing an ad jingle “Just One Cornetto,” according to Tina Brown’s book <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Diana_Chronicles/TOgnHjKG_6sC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=princess+diana+prince+charles+skit+royal+opera+house+%E2%80%9CJust+One+Cornetto.%E2%80%9D&pg=PA243&printsec=frontcover" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Diana Chronicles" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Diana Chronicles</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But apparently, this was different — a line had seemingly been crossed.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Diana and Sleep forged a friendship, bonding over their loneliness</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite what may have happened between the royal couple, Diana loved the freedom she felt when she was on the stage — it was such a far cry from her normally stiff lifestyle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A few days later, Sleep received a letter from his star pupil. “Now I understand the buzz you get from performing,” she wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pulling off such a tremendous feat bonded the two and they became tight friends. Sometimes she would go to his shows and visit him in his dressing room afterward and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/14/thats-me-diana-dance-wayne-sleep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="other times" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">other times</a> she would have dinner at his south Kensington flat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She would kick off her shoes and we’d have a giggle, talking about this and that: her kids, my work, nothing controversial,” Sleep said. “I’d cook, and she’d wash up. Her security would wait across the road, in my studio.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He thought that perhaps they got along because they were both “loners” who carved out their own paths. He also helped her appreciate the mundane things in life that she wasn’t able to as such a public figure. “I would buy her silly postcards,” he said. “She loved them, but couldn’t go into shops and buy them herself.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But eventually, they grew apart — and Sleep wonders if it might have had to do with a photo leak that happened a decade after their decade.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In 1995, these pictures – taken by the Royal Opera House’s photographer – appeared in the tabloids,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/14/thats-me-diana-dance-wayne-sleep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Guardian</a>. “No one knows for sure how they got hold of them. Diana got suspicious – by then, she didn’t know who to trust anymore – and we drifted apart.”</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Dancing Diana made headlines twice in 1985</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The timing of her surprise dance came just a month after Princess Diana had famously hit the dance floor on the other side of the Atlantic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At a White House party in November 1985 during Charles and Diana’s royal tour of the United States, Diana showed off her twinkle toes by accepting actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/john-travolta data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Travolta" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">John Travolta</a>'s invitation to dance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They ended up on the dance floor for 15 minutes, which <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/princess-diana-john-travolta-dance-white-house data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he now calls" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">he now calls</a> “one of the highlights of my life.”</p><img alt="Princess Diana trying on a kimono that she received as a gift at Nijo Castle, Kyoto, during an official visit to Japan on May 1986" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1_-princess-diana-1961---1997-trying-on-a-kimono-that-she-received-as-a-gift-at-nijo-castle-kyoto-during-an-official-visit-to-japan-on-may-1986-photo-by-georges-de-keerlegetty-images.jpg title="Princess Diana trying on a kimono that she received as a gift at Nijo Castle, Kyoto, during an official visit to Japan on May 1986" width=3477 height=5127 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGipqLGRocG6e8%2BroKeblajAbrDImqWaZaKkxqK4jKinnqqRYrWwwdKeZJ2Znpiy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
