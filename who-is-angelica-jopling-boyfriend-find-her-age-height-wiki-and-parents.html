Although most people might know her as the daughter of Sam, she is a prominent actress on her own right. So far, she has worked on multiple movies and shows. Her latest acting credit dates back to 2013. She has been inactive on show business since then. She last appeared in the movie&nbsp;Kick-Ass 2&nbsp;as Lois. This was back in 2013 and she has chosen to keep her life away from the media spotlight since then. Moreover, she is not active on Instagram as well which has caused there to be very little information about her career. She is probably focused on her education at the moment. Maybe she has decided not to follow on the footsteps of her mother who is a successful actress. Here is what we can find about her life and career that she has kept quite private.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=parents-and-family-details></span>Parents and Family Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Angelica Jopling was born to parents&nbsp;Sam Taylor-Johnson&nbsp;and Jay Jopling.
