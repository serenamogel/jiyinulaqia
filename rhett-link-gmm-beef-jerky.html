Rhett correctly noted that the number of beef jerky purveyors has exploded in recent years with the rise of paleo and low-carb diets, so there’s a bunch of new jerky to sift through.</p><p>The guys scored six of the most popular jerky brands on market (all “original” flavor) and tried them all to determine “which dried out, shriveled up meat treat is the best to eat, Pete.” Does the protein craze equal tastier dehydrated beef? Does jerky actually make your farts stinkier? Look, you’re going to have to conduct your own experiments at home, preferably by yourself.

The guys reported that this was the priciest jerky they tried, and decided that it’s not worth the extra cost. “It’s more about the seasoning than the meat,” Link said. “And you either like the seasoning or you don’t.” You’ll have to try for yourself if you’re curious.&nbsp;</p><strong>Krave Sea Salt Original</strong><p>If you like tender jerky, this one might not be for you. On the other hand, if you like a certain fast food restaurant, you might love it. “It tastes like beef from Taco Bell,” Link said after taking a second bite of the crumbly meat, which he said “kind of comes apart in pieces.” Rhett really liked the flavor and said it rivals Jack Links, but this one still landed near the bottom of the list.</p><strong>Oberto Original</strong><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy from Amazon</a><p>Sometimes jerky gets points just for, you know, being jerky. “The jerk factor is really high,” Link said after taking a bite of Oberto. “You gotta really jerk your head back.” Rhett didn’t love the tough, gristly texture, but Oberto as ended up ranking fourth simply for remaining faithful to the concept of jerky.</p><strong>Jacks Link’s Original</strong><p>Rhett & Link loved Jacks Link’s jerky for its tender texture, thick cut, and smoky taste. “I can definitely taste burning wood,” said Link. Jacks Link’s started the taste test in the number three spot and ended there as well. A solid choice if you’re looking for something smoky and affordable.&nbsp;</p><strong>Chef’s Cut Original Recipe</strong><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy from Amazon</a><p>“This is just like setting a piece of beef on a board and letting it dry,” said Rhett. Both Rhett & Link agreed that Chef’s Cut is on the drier side, and Link didn’t like that it fell apart so easily. Still, this jerky has its virtues. . “This is like steak in a bag,” Rhett said, before later comparing it to brisket. But Link didn’t like that this jerky fell apart easily. Yup, Chef’s Cut is a bit on the crumbly side, but the quality of the meat is so high that it took second place.&nbsp;</p><strong>Country Archer Original</strong><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy from Amazon</a><p>“Wow, that’s good jerky! Man, that’s so next level,” exclaimed Rhett. “It tastes just like a steak at a restaurant.” Hecouldn’t stop eating this one and even used the word “exquisite” to describe it. “I didn’t think you could get as tender as Jack Link’s, but this is almost twice as tender,” added Link. This was their unanimous pick for the number one spot.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="What's The Best Beef Jerky?
