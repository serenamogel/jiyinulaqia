While in prison, he became a writer and was championed by some Austrian intellectuals. He was released only to kill nine more sex workers in Europe and Los Angeles. He was convicted of the murders and found dead on June 29, 1994, having committed suicide.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unterweger was born Johann Unterweger on August 16, 1950, in Austria. Abandoned by his prostitute mother, Jack lived for seven years with an alcoholic grandfather. He turned to crime in his early teens and was first arrested at 16 for assaulting a prostitute.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Murder and Best-Selling Novel</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1976, Unterweger was convicted of the murder of Margaret Schaefer and sentenced to life in prison. While in prison, he learned to read and write, eventually earning literary respect both inside and outside the prison. In 1984, his prison autobiography Fegefeuer oder die Reise ins Zuchthaus (Purgatory or the Trip to Jail - Report of a Guilty Man) (1983) became a best-seller. Convinced that he was a reformed man, the state released him on parole in 1990.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his release, Unterweger became a literary celebrity, appearing on talk shows and booking speaking engagements. Fegefeuer was made into a feature film, and the former murderer became a journalist.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sentenced Again and Suicide</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Not everyone was convinced of his transformation, however. After a string of prostitute murders matched the details of the Schaefer crime, police put Unterweger under surveillance. After several months of detective work, they had gathered enough evidence to arrest him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1992, Unterweger was detained, but even then, he continued to give interviews freely, proclaiming his innocence and calling upon his colleagues for support. Despite his chatty demeanor, the evidence against him was overwhelming, and he was found guilty of nine counts of murder in 1994. Soon after sentencing, Unterweger used the string from his prison jumpsuit to hang himself.</p><ul data-node-id=14 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Johann Unterweger</li><li>Birth Year: 1950</li><li>Birth date: August 16, 1950</li><li>Birth City: Styria</li><li>Birth Country: Austria</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Jack Unterweger was an Austrian serial killer who murdered several women before committing suicide in 1994.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Crime and Terrorism</li><li>Journalism and Nonfiction</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Leo</li><li>Nationalities</li><li>Death Year: 1994</li><li>Death date: June 29, 1994</li><li>Death City: Graz</li><li>Death Country: Austria</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.
