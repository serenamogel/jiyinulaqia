At the time Affleck was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/new-again-ben-affleck data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="eight years old" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">eight years old</a> and Damon was ten. As the two lived a couple of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1998-01-02-1998002104-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="blocks away from each other" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">blocks away from each other</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts, they spent plenty of time together as children and they also attended the same high school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The pair shot to stardom with their 1997 movie <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/affleck-and-damons-good-will-hunting-debuts data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Good Will Hunting" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Good Will Hunting</a>, which starred Damon as the title character and featured Affleck as Will's best friend. The movie went on to receive acclaim, and the pair won an Academy Award for co-writing the movie's screenplay. In addition to this accomplishment, the two pals have consistently supported and encouraged each other over the course of their lives.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Their friendship was cemented after Affleck defended Damon in a fight</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2019/11/05/matt-damon-ben-affleck-fight-cambridge data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Conan class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Conan</a> in 2019, Damon shared that he'd once been on the verge of getting beaten up by a bigger kid. At the last second, a school-age Affleck "tackled this dude off of me. Like, out of nowhere." For Damon, Affleck hadn't only spared him from a fight, he'd cemented their friendship. "I remember that was a big moment. Like, 'This guy will put himself in a really bad spot for me. This is a good friend.'" They also came through for each other by defending their choice to pursue acting careers to parents who, given the low odds of success in the entertainment industry, were understandably worried.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Affleck began acting at a young age, as a family friend was a casting director and introduced him to the industry. But Damon helped his friend become serious about the craft. Affleck explained to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/50121/parade/interview-with-ben-affleck/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Parade class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Parade</a> magazine in 2007, "Before Matt, I was by myself. Acting was a solo activity where I’d just go off and do something, act in a little TV show or something, and no one understood it. None of the other kids knew what it was I did, how it worked, or anything. All of a sudden I had this friend, Matt, and he gets it and wants to do it and thinks it's interesting and wants to talk about it. Soon both of us are doing it."</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The pair held 'business lunches' in high school to plan their future</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Damon has said that filmmaking became a shared pursuit for the two friends. "We were both in love with the same thing — acting and filmmaking. I think we fed on each other’s obsession during really formative, important years and that bonded us for life," Damon told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/movies/193595_matt_damon_on_growing_up_with_ben_affleck_and_why_he_s_glad_his_wife_s_not_famous data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ET Online" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">ET Online</a>. According to Damon's brother, the two were "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://people.com/celebrity/ben-affleck-soars-to-sexy/?slide=2000362#2000362" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="drama geeks" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">drama geeks</a>" in high school. During high school, they shared what they called "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/ben-affleck-matt-damon-we-have-great-wives/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="business lunches" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">business lunches</a>" to work on plans for the future, and as teens, they sometimes traveled together for auditions in New York City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When it was time to head to college — Harvard University for Damon and, initially, the University of Vermont for Affleck — the two remained close. Affleck once explained in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/new-again-ben-affleck data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Interview magazine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Interview magazine</a>, "Matt and I had identical interests, so whether we ended up successful or making hot dogs at Dodgers games, we knew we’d end up doing the same sort of thing. The remaining friends part was pretty consistent. We saw each other all the time, we talked on the phone all the time." When they both left school to try to make it as actors, they often <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/1997/12/matt-damon-199712 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lived together" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">lived together</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A few years later, their trust and respect for one another allowed Damon and Affleck to co-write the script for Good Will Hunting, and then reap the rewards of that breakout hit.</p><img alt="Matt Damon and Ben Affleck" title="Matt Damon and Ben Affleck" width=3000 height=2234 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-152706230.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span><p>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck after winning the Best Screenplay Oscar in 1998.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early on, Damon and Affleck would pool their incomes</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Damon and Affleck did more than encourage each other to act — they were there for one another financially. "Ben Affleck and I actually had a joint bank account, and the bank account was money that we'd made doing local commercials and we could only use it on trips to New York to audition," Damon said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1103/03/pmt.01.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">CNN</a> in 2011. He has stated that this attitude was only natural, as their friendship had always followed those rules. "If one kid had enough for a candy bar, then the candy bar was bought and split in half — that’s just the way it’s been," he explained to Interview.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After they'd moved on from being kids <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1998-01-03-9801020382-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shooting commercials" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">shooting commercials</a> to trying to survive on their own as struggling actors, Damon and Affleck still pooled incomes. If one got a role, that money was available to the other until the next part came in.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With the success of Good Will Hunting, they were able to put that training into practice. The two started a production company and created the reality show Project Greenlight to provide aspiring filmmakers with the opportunity to see their projects become reality.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The pair knows how to have fun through life's highs and lows</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Growing up, Damon and Affleck had fun playing Little League or Dungeons and Dragons. In later years, they'd hang out in Harvard Square. When they were older, Damon has revealed they'd usually "end up at the same bar every night with the same people telling the same old jokes."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The pair also enjoyed their time as struggling actors. "Those times were fun!" Affleck told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/ben-affleck-matt-damon-we-have-great-wives/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>. "We had a great time! We were young, we didn't have the kinds of fears that you have when you get into your forties if you haven't gotten to where you want to go. We were in our twenties and we just had a blast!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And being successful Hollywood stars hasn't kept the two from indulging in the same kind of camaraderie. In a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://defamer.gawker.com/watch-ben-affleck-and-matt-damon-make-fun-of-each-othe-1522400894 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=video class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">video</a> to raise money for a charity that offered the chance for someone to go on "a best friend double date" with them, Damon teased his friend: "Ben Affleck's left eye twitches every time you say the word Gigli." This was a reference to the 2003 movie — co-starring <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jennifer-lopez data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Lopez" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jennifer Lopez</a>, whose romance with Affleck received nonstop tabloid attention — that became a notorious flop. In the same video, Affleck noted "how incredibly short Matt Damon is." In 2016, Affleck smuggled Damon onto the set of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.today.com/popculture/ben-affleck-sneaks-matt-damon-jimmy-kimmel-live-t76671 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jimmy Kimmel Live!" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> in defiance of the humorous "feud" between Kimmel and Damon.</p><img alt="Matt Damon and Ben Affleck" title="Matt Damon and Ben Affleck" width=5129 height=3529 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-631368526.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Getty Images</span><p>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in 2017</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">They still have each other's backs through life's biggest changes</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Decades may have passed since they worked together on Good Will Hunting, but they continue to encourage and respect one another's work. Damon has said he'd love to be directed by his friend. However, he explained to ET Online that Affleck tends to keep his best roles close to home: "He's a brilliant director, but the problem is that he always gives the best parts to himself. So until he starts including the rest of us, I think we just have to go watch him be great in his movies."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The pair has also remained close as they made the transition from single bachelors to married family men. Affleck might've missed Damon's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/898058/inside-ben-affleck-and-matt-damon-s-enduring-friendship-how-they-survived-scandal-heartbreak-and-tabloid-fodder data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="City Hall wedding" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">City Hall wedding</a> in 2005, but he later attended his vow renewal in St. Lucia. Their families, along with Affleck's younger brother Casey, have gone skiing together. For a time, they were neighbors when Damon moved into a home on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/martians-matt-damon-talks-bourne-828093 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="same street" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">same street</a> as Affleck in Pacific Palisades, California.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Years later, the two still have each other's backs. In 2015, Damon spoke up for his friend in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/martians-matt-damon-talks-bourne-828093 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Hollywood Reporter</a>: "It was like he was being cast in a role, that he was a talentless kind of meathead, with his whole relationship with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jennifer-lopez data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Lopez" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jennifer Lopez</a>. He just got cast as this person that he wasn't. It was just really painful. It was painful to be his friend, because it wasn't fair, you know? To my mind, nobody really got him at all. And through his work, he climbed from the bottom of the mountain all the way back up to the top and past where either of us had ever been."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Damon has also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-divorce-actor-leans-on-matt-damon/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="been there for his friend " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">been there for his friend </a>at other difficult moments, including when Affleck's marriage to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jennifer-garner data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Garner" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jennifer Garner</a> fell apart.
